The sequence ordinarily includes a washing operation, a rinsing operation in which the clothes are rinsed in clean water, and a final extraction operation in which the rinse water is removed from the clothes. Additive dispensers have been provided so that the operator may introduce a measured amount of detergent or soap prior to the start of the operation. In the same manner, appropriate water softeners and fabric softeners may be automatically added to the rinse water even though put in the machine prior to the start of the cycle. \\n     In addition to detergents, soap and softening agents, it will readily occur that a suitable liquid bleach or bleaching agent are among the more important additives required by many operators for a large part of their washing operations. The dispensing of bleach raises peculiar problems in that it is imperative that the bleach not directly contact the clothes before they are submerged in water or until the bleach is diluted in water. Also, due to the difficulties created by the highly corrosive nature of most of the commercially available bleaches provided for clothes washing purposes, it is necessary that great care be taken in the storage of bleach. To this end, some prior art attempts at dispensing bleach has been to provide a separate dispenser means for bleach which enables the operator to place the bleach directly into the outer tub where it may be diluted during the water fill operation. While this solves the problem of dispensing bleach, it does require a dispenser separate from the dispenser used for dispensing other additives and is therefore somewhat inconvenient. \\n     Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an additive dispenser adapted to be mounted on the oscillatory agitator which is adapted to deliver a charge of liquid rinse additive into the basket following a sequence of operations which include a washing operation and a high speed centrifugal extraction of the wash water, which extraction immediately precedes the operation in which the liquid rinse addition is to be utilized, and is further adapted to permit a liquid bleach to be dispensed directly into the outer tub prior to the washing cycle where it will be diluted by the water entering during the initial fill operation. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates to a clothes washing appliance of the vertical axis type having an imperforate outer tub for retaining washing liquid and a basket mounted in the tub for containing clothes to be washed. The basket has a perforate side wall and a bottom wall including liquid circulating openings which slopes downwardly from a position adjacent the vertical axis to a lower portion at the outer circumference of the side wall. Mounted in the basket on the vertical axis for rotation with said basket is an agitator for imparting washing action to the clothes. The washing operation is carried out by drive means that effect a relatively low rotational speed oscillation of the agitator during a washing action of the clothes and a high spin speed rotation of the basket during a high spin extraction action. The agitator includes a central housing means in the form of a hollow centerpost defining a conduit extending through the hollow centerpost between an open upper end to its lower end adjacent the bottom wall of said basket. \\n     An additive dispensing means is arranged in the upper end of the centerpost defining an outer housing and a cavity having its lower end portion positioned in the hollow centerpost for receiving additive to be dispensed. The cavity is spaced from the outer housing to provide a passageway therebetween so that the additive being discharged from the cavity by centrifugal force during the extraction action will flow through the passageway and the conduit in the hollow centerpost to a position on the bottom wall of the basket below the agitator. Included in the dispenser is a passageway arranged to bypass the cavity and to communicate directly with the hollow centerpost for introducing treating agent to a position on the bottom wall below the agitator for dilution by liquid entering the outer tub during a subsequent fill operation. \\n     An additive diverting means including a body portion is positioned on at least a portion of the sloping bottom wall of the basket which includes openings aligned with the liquid circulating openings in the bottom wall of the basket for conducting additive therethrough into the outer tub to insure that the additive will be diluted in the liquid introduced into the outer tub prior to a subsequent washing action. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of a vertical axis clothes washing machine including one embodiment of the additive dispensing system of the present invention, the view being partially broken away in order to illustrate details; \\n     FIG. 2 is a plan view partially broken away showing certain details of the dispensing system of FIG. 1; \\n     FIG. 3 is a plan view of the additive diverter employed in the dispensing system of the present invention; \\n     FIG. 4 is a side elevational view of another embodiment of the additive dispenser employed in the dispensing system of the present invention; and \\n     FIG. 5 is a side elevational view of still another embodiment of the additive dispenser. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT \\n     Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a vertical axis washing machine 10 of the vertical axis type which includes a cabinet 12. Within the cabinet 12 is disposed an imperforate stationary outer tub 14. Within the imperforate tub 14 there is disposed a basket or receptacle 16 for receiving fabric articles, such as clothing, to be washed. The basket side wall 18 includes a plurality of apertures 20 for discharge of water during a centrifugal extraction or fast spinning portion of the operating cycle of the machine. The bottom wall 22 of the basket 16 slopes downwardly from the center axis to a lower portion at the outer circumference of the side wall 18. A plurality of openings 24 (FIGS. 1 and 3) are formed in the bottom wall 22 which, as will be explained hereinafter, function in recirculating liquid between the basket 16 and tub 14 during the wash operation. The tub 14 is comprised of an imperforate side wall 26 and a generally imperforate and substantially horizontally disposed bottom wall 28 having a single drain opening 30 formed in a sump portion 32 of the bottom wall 28. The tub is mounted on a stationary support flange 29 arranged on the vertical axis. At the center of the basket 16 there is positioned a vertical axis agitator 34 which includes a vertical hollow centerpost 36 defining a passageway 37, a base or skirt portion 35 spaced from the bottom wall 22 and a plurality of vanes 38 extending outwardly from the vertical post 36 thereof. The agitator hollow centerpost 36 is concentrically mounted about a centerpost 42, and is driven by an oscillatory agitator drive shaft 44 by means of a drive motor 46. The agitator is mounted on the shaft 44 through a centering means 39 which drivingly engages the inner wall of passageway 37. The centering means 39 is formed with a plurality of apertures 41 which provide means of communication between the upper portion of passageway 37 and the lower portion which communicates with basket bottom wall 22 beneath the skirt portion 35 of agitator 34. The basket 16 is mounted on a flange 47 of a rotatable spin hub 49, and is driven by a sleeve 51 by means of the motor 46. \\n     The skirt portion 35 of the agitator 34 extends outwardly and downwardly in spaced relationship with the bottom wall 22 of basket 16. The area between the skirt 35 and wall 22 forms an agitator driven pump through which liquid is pumped radially outwardly by pumping vanes 52 formed on the skirt 35. During the washing portion of the cycle, the vanes drain liquid from the lower portion of tub 14 through openings 24 and flows outwardly by the centrifugal force imparted by the agitator 34. Liquid then flows through the holes 20 and downwardly into the tub sump area 32 and then returned to the interior of the basket through openings 24. \\n     Hot and cold water may be supplied to the machine through conduits 51 and 53 which are adapted to be connected respectively to sources of hot and cold water (not shown). Conduits 51 and 53 extend into a conventional mixing valve structure 54 having solenoids 56 and 58 and being connected to a hose 60 which is positioned to discharge water into the basket 16. In a conventional manner selective or concurrent energization of the solenoids 56 and 58 will provide the passage of hot, cold or warm water from the mixing valve 54 through hose 60 to discharge water into the basket 16 and tub 14. \\n     During operation of the machine in the washing cycle, the agitator 34 driven by shaft 44 through centering means 39 is first oscillated back and forth within the basket 16 to wash clothes therein. Then, after a predetermined period of this washing action, the basket 16 is driven by spin hub 49, and then rotated at high speed to extract centrifugally the washing liquid and discharge it into the outer tub 14 for draining from the machine through the drain openings 30. Liquid from the drain 30 is carried from the machine by a pump 31 which may be energized during the extraction operation or a selected portion thereof. \\n     In accordance with the present invention and as clearly illustrated in the drawings, the hollow centerpost 36 of the agitator serves to house and support the dispenser device generally indicated at 62. The dispenser device 62 of one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, is adapted to deliver additive which when dispensed at full strength should normally not come into direct contact with clothes being washed. The additives contemplated by the present invention are, for example, rinse agents which have a tendency to spot clothes and liquid bleach which will damage cloth if allowed to contact cloth at full strength. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawing, the dispensing device 62 comprises an outer bowl-shaped housing 64 that extends above the centerpost and radially outwardly therefrom. Arranged concentrically in the outer housing 64 is a cone-shaped cavity 66 having its lower narrow end 67 concentrically arranged within the dimensions of the hollow passageway 37 of centerpost 36 and its larger upper open end 69 positioned within the housing 64. The cavity 66 is spaced from inner walls of passageway 37 and housing 64 by a plurality of radial spokes 68 which provide a passageway 71 in communication with the interior of the housing 64 and the passageway 37. \\n     Means are provided for allowing additive, such as a rinse agent, to be inserted into the dispenser device 62. To this end, a cover portion 70 is arranged on the housing 64. The cover as shown in FIG. 2 is formed with a first arcuate additive-receiving channel or depression 76. The arcuate channel 76 is dimensioned so that the downwardly extending side walls thereof are positioned within the upper open end 69 of cavity 66, as shown in FIG. 1. A dispensing opening 78 is provided in the bottom wall of the channel 76 to facilitate the introduction of rinse agent to the cavity 66. The opening 78 is shown in FIG. 2 as being a single arcuate opening; however, a plurality of spaced openings may be effectively employed. Rinse agent additive to be introduced into cavity 66 is placed in the channel 76 and allowed to flow through opening 78 into the cavity 66 to be dispensed therefrom. \\n     In operation, the rinse agent placed in cavity 66 prior to the washing operation is held in cavity 66 during oscillation or washing action of the agitator. During the ensuing high spin extraction cycle, the rinse agent is centrifugally thrown out over the top open end 69 of cavity 66 and into an area designated &#34;A&#34; (FIG. 1) in the upper portion of the inner peripheral wall of the housing 64. At the completion of the extraction cycle, the rinse agent as indicated by arrows will then flow downwardly from the area &#34;A&#34; of housing 64 through passageway 71 and into passageway 37, aperture 41, to the bottom wall 22 of the basket 16 in a position below the skirt portion 35 where it then flows downwardly toward openings 24 and into the bottom of tub 14. The rinse agent according to the invention has therefore been inserted into the washing machine in a manner that precludes its coming into contact with the clothes being washed in the basket. \\n     In dispensing liquid bleach, the cover portion 70 (FIG. 2) is provided with a second arcuate bleach-receiving channel or depression 80 having its side walls extending downwardly to a position above the upper open end 69 of cavity 66. The channel 80 is further formed with a funnel-shaped sump 82 which extends downwardly from channel 80. The sump is formed to include a discharge opening 84. It is imperative, as mentioned above, that the bleach not come in contact with clothes being washed. However, it is also imperative that the bleach not mix with the rinse agent since the chemical reaction between the two is not desirable. Accordingly, while the sump 82 extends below the upper edge of the cavity 66 it is positioned outside of cavity 66. To this end, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a passageway is provided in the form of a detent or depression 86 formed in the side wall of cavity 66. The sump 82 is positioned within the dimensions of the passageway 86. Accordingly, the sump 82 including opening 84 communicates with the passageway 37 through the passageway provided by depression 86 and passageway 71. \\n     In operation, the liquid bleach is inserted into channel 80 prior to the washing operation. The bleach introduced into channel 80 flows directly through depression 86 and passageway 37 of centerpost 36 to the bottom wall 22 of basket 16 and toward openings 24 to the bottom of tub 14 prior to the washing cycle in the same manner as the rinse agent is introduced into tub 14 subsequent to the extraction cycle following the wash cycle. The liquid bleach so directed to the outer tub is then in a position to be diluted by the wash water as it enters the outer tub 14 prior to the washing cycle. \\n     Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, there are shown means provided by the present invention to insure that all of the rinse agent and liquid bleach flowing through passageway 37 of centerpost 36 flows through openings 24 and into the outer tub 14. To this end, a dish-shaped diverter member 88 (FIG. 3) is provided which is shaped comlementary to the bottom wall 22. The diverter member 88 arranged on the wall 22 is dimensioned to be located completely below the skirt 35 of agitator 34 as shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 3, the member 88 is formed with a central collar portion which is positioned on the centerpost 42. Also formed on member 88 are a plurality of openings 90 which match in number and shape the openings 24 in bottom wall 22. Extending downwardly along the peripheral edge portion of the openings 90 is a wall portion 92 which acts to index member 88 relative to wall 22 and to align openings 90 thereof with openings 24 in wall 22. An upwardly extending circumferential wall 94 is formed so as to be tangent with the outer radial edge portion of the openings 90. The wall 94 is impervious to insure that all of the rinse agent and liquid bleach flowing through centerpost 36 and downwardly on wall 22 is directed through the opening 90 and, accordingly, opening 24. \\n     Referring now to FIG. 4 of the drawings, there is shown another embodiment of the invention wherein similar parts are designated by the same reference characters employed in describing the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2. The cover 70 in this embodiment is formed with an annular channel 100 for receiving the rinse agent to be dispensed in cavity 66, and a central funnel-shaped channel 102 for receiving the bleach to be dispensed into the passageway 37 of centerpost 36. The channel 100 has its lower annular wall positioned within and below the peripheral upper end 69 of the cavity. Formed in the lower wall of channel 100 are a plurality of circumferentially disposed openings 104 communicating with the cavity 66. Rinse agent introduced into the cavity 66 through openings 104 is delivered to the tub 14 in the same manner described in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2. In this embodiment, bleach is delivered into passageway 37 through a central conduit 106 extending vertically through and isolated from cavity 66. The channel 102 has its lower open end 108 positioned in the upper open end of conduit 106 so that bleach introduced into central channel 102 bypasses cavity 66 and flows directly through the passageway 37 in centerpost 36 in the same manner described in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2. \\n     Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown still another embodiment of the invention wherein similar parts are designated by the reference characters employed in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2. The cover portion 70 in this embodiment is formed to include an annular channel 110 for receiving liquid bleach. Formed in the lower wall of channel 110 are a plurality of openings 112 which are located radially outwardly of the outer upper end 69 of cavity 66 so that liquid bleach introduced into channel 110 is received directly into the passageway 37 of centerpost 36 through passageway 71 and therethrough in the same manner described in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 and 2. Rinse agent in this embodiment is introduced into the cavity 66 through a central funnel-shaped channel 114 formed in the cover 70 which has its lower open end 116 arranged over the cavity 66. \\n     In summary, by the present invention a dispenser system has been provided wherein additive may be introduced into the machine without coming directly into contact with the clothes being washed. In the case of dispensing liquid bleach, it is inserted into the washing machine in a manner which precludes its coming into contact with clothes to be washed and in a position wherein the initial liquid fill cycle will dilute the bleach prior to the start of the wash cycle, while in the case of dispensing rinse agent, it will be delivered into the washing machine after the initial wash cycle and extraction cycle in a manner which also precludes its coming into contact with the clothes to be washed. \\n     It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the embodiment described heretofore is considered to be the presently preferred form of this invention. In accordance with the Patent Statutes, changes may be made in the disclosed apparatus and the manner in which it is used without actually departing from the true spirit and scope of this invention.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates to a fiber-treatment agent composition. Fiber-treatment agents based on organopolysiloxane containing the group represented by the formula --CH 2  CH 2  CH 2  NHCH 2  CH 2  NH 2  have been used to impart lubricity to fibrous materials composed of natural fibers such as cotton, flax, silk, wool, angora, and mohair; regenerated fibers such as rayon and Bemberg; semisynthetic fibers such as acetate; and synthetic fibers such as polyesters, polyamides, polyacrylonitriles, polyvinyl chlorides, Vinylon, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, and Spandex. Refer to Japanese Patent Publication Number 57-43673 (43,673/82). However, fibers treated with such an organopolysiloxane containing the group represented by the formula --CH 2  CH 2  CH 2  NHCH 2  cH 2  NH 2  are subject to yellowing due to a spontaneous oxidation occurring with time. Moreover, when continuous lubrication using rollers is carried out from a bath containing such an organopolysiloxane lubricant, moisture and carbon dioxide are absorbed from the atmosphere, and a white turbidity appears in the bath and the precipitation of a gel occurs. Furthermore, when such an organopolysiloxane is used for high-temperature oiling or lubrication as in the treatment of carbon fiber, for example, polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fiber, the organopolysiloxane is degraded to a gum, which sticks on the rollers, etc. This has the unfortunate effect of causing the fiber to snap. \\n     BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention, having as its object a solution to the aforementioned problems, introduces a fiber-treatment agent which not only imparts excellent lubrication and softness, but which also does not yellow the fibrous material and is not subject to gelation or gum formation or the development of a white turbidity during storage, treatment, or heating. \\n     The aforesaid object is achieved by means of a fiber-treatment agent composition comprising (A) an organopolysiloxane represented by the formula ##STR1## wherein R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group; A is an R group or a group with the formula --R 1  (NHCH 2 ,CH 2 ,) a  NH 2 ,; R 1  is a divalent hydrocarbon group; a=zero to 10; p and q are zero or more; with the proviso that p+q=10 to 2,000, and there is at least one --R 1  (NHCH 2 ,CH 2 ,) a  NH 2  group in each molecule; and (B) 0.2 to 5.0 moles, per 1 mole of primary and secondary amino groups in component (A), of a compound represented by the formula R 2 ,O(C 2  H 4  O) b  R 3  COOH wherein R 2  is a monovalent hydrocarbon group having 10 to 20 carbon atoms, b is at least one, and R 3  is a divalent hydrocarbon group. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \\n     To explain the preceding in greater detail, component (A) is an organopolysiloxane as represented by the following general formula and which has at least one --R 1  (NHCH 2  CH 2 ) a  NH 2  group in each molecule. ##STR2## \\n     In the above organopolysiloxane formula R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group; A is an R group or a group with the formula --R 1  (NHCH 2  CH 2 ) a  NH 2  ; R 1  is a divalent hydrocarbon group; a=zero to 10; p and q are zero or more; with the proviso that p+q=10 to 2,000. \\n     R in the above formula is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, as exemplified by alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl; aralkyl groups such as 2-phenylethyl and 2-phenylpropyl; halogen-substituted alkyl groups such as 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl; alkenyl groups such as vinyl, propenyl, and butadienyl; cycloalkyl groups such as cyclohexyl; aryl groups such as phenyl and naphthyl; and alkayl groups such as tolyl and xenyl. Alkyl, alkenyl, and aryl groups are preferred. Furthermore, within a single molecule, R may be only a single species or may comprise different species. \\n     R 1  in the above formula is a divalent hydrocarbon group, and examples in this regard are alkylene groups such as methylene, n-propylene, n-butylene, isobutylene, and isopropylene; arylene groups such as phenylene; and alkylenearylene groups such as ethylenephenylene. Alkylene is typically selected from among these. The value of a is zero to 10, and p and q are numbers with values of zero or more. \\n     A is --R 1  (NHCH 2  CH 2 ) a  NH 2  or an R group. When both of the two A groups are --R 1  (NHCH 2  CH 2 ) a  NH 2 , q may be zero. \\n     Furthermore, the value of p+q is to be 10 to 2,000. The basis for this is as follows. Only a meager softness and smoothness are imparted to the fibrous material at values below 10, while emulsification becomes difficult at values in excess of 2,000. \\n     Considering the structure of component (A), it is the diorganopolysiloxane moiety which functions to develop softness and smoothness, while the amino group moiety functions to form a salt with component (B). \\n     Component (B) comprises a compound as represented by the general formula R 2  O(C 2  H 4  O) b  R 3  COOH. It forms a salt with the amino groups in component (A), or forms an amide bond with the amino groups in component (A) according to the heating conditions, and functions to improve both the stability of the composition and the resistance to yellowing. In addition, this component functions to improve the emulsion stability when the composition under consideration is emulsified. \\n     The group R 2  in the above formula is a monovalent hydrocarbon group having 10 to 20 carbon atoms, and examples in this regard are branched alkyl groups and linear alkyl groups such as the undecyl group, lauryl group, myristyl group, and cetyl group; alkenyl groups such as the oleyl group; alkaryl groups such the octylphenyl group and nonylphenyl group; and aralkyl groups such as the phenyloctyl group. While b should have a value of at least one, values of 3 to 15 are preferred. R 3  is a divalent hydrocarbon group, and examples here are alkylene groups such as methylene, ethylene, propylene, and isobutylene, as well as alkylenearylene groups such as the --C 2  H 4  C 6  H 4  -- group. Alkylene groups are preferred, and the methylene group is particularly preferred. \\n     Component (B) can be obtained, for example, by an addition reaction between ethylene oxide and stearyl alcohol or octylphenol, followed by carboxylation by a dehydrochlorination reaction with monochloroacetic acid or similar compounds. \\n     The component (B) under consideration is employed in a quantity giving 0.2 to 5.0 moles per 1 mole primary and secondary amino groups in component (A). Yellowing prevention and the prevention of the development of gel and white turbidity do not appear at less than 0.2 moles. Furthermore, the hand becomes poor in excess of 5 moles. \\n     The composition of the present invention may be prepared by simply mixing components (A) and (B) to uniformity; however, mixing while heating at 40 to 180 degrees Centigrade is preferred. \\n     The composition of the present invention can be directly adhered as such on fibrous materials, but treatment may also be conducted with it dissolved in an organic solvent, for example, toluene, xylene, benzene, n-hexane, heptane, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, mineral turpentine, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, etc. Treatment may also be conducted with it emulsified using a cationic or nonionic surfactant. \\n     Examples of cationic surfactants in this regard are quaternary ammonium hydroxides (and salts thereof) such as octyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, dodecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, hexadecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, octyldimethylbenzylammonium hydroxide, decyldimethylbenzylammonium hydroxide, didodecyldimethylammonium hydroxide, dioctadecyldimethylammonium hydroxide, beef tallow trimethylammonium hydroxide, and cocotrimethylammonium hydroxide. \\n     Examples of nonionic surfactants in this regard are polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyalkylene alkylphenol ethers, polyoxyalkylene alkyl esters, polyoxyalkylene sorbitan alkyl esters, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, and diethylene glycol. \\n     The surfactant is preferably used at 5 to 50 weight parts and more preferably at 10 to 30 weight parts per 100 weight parts organopolysiloxane comprising component (A). \\n     While water may be used in arbitrary quantities and its use quantity is not crucial, in general it will be used in a quantity affording an organopolysiloxane concentration of 5 to 60 weight%. It is particularly preferred that water be used in a quantity giving an organopolysiloxane concentration of 10 to 40 weight%. \\n     To emulsify the composition of the present invention, the surfactant as described above and a small quantity of the water are added to and mixed to homogeneity into the mixture of components (A) and (B). This may then be emulsified using an emulsifying device such as an homogenizer, colloid mill, line mixer, propeller mixer, vacuum emulsifier, or similar devices. \\n     Furthermore, the composition of the present invention may also contain other additives as known to the art, such as antistatics, softeners, creaseproofing agents, heat stabilizers, flame retardants, etc. \\n     The fibrous material can be treated using methods such as spray adhesion, roll application, brushing, immersion, dipping, etc. The add-on or uptake quantity will vary with the fibrous material and thus cannot be rigorously specified; however, in general it will fall within the range of 0.01 to 10.0 weight% as organopolysiloxane fraction based on fibrous material. The fibrous material is then allowed to stand at the ambient temperature, subjected to a hot air flow, or is heat treated. \\n     The fibrous material may be composed of, for example, natural fiber such as wool, silk, flax, cotton, angora, mohair, and asbestos; regenerated fiber such as rayon and Bemberg; semisynthetic fiber such as acetate; synthetic fiber such as polyesters, polyamides, polyacrylonitriles, polyvinyl chlorides, Vinylon, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, and Spandex; and inorganic fiber such as glass fibers, carbon fibers, and silicon carbide fibers. It may take the form of, for example, the staple, filament, tow, top, or yarn, and in its structure may be, for example, a weave, knit, or nonwoven fabric. \\n     EXAMPLES \\n     The present invention is explained in greater detail, but not limited, in the following by illustrative examples. In the examples, unless specified otherwise, parts = weight parts, % = weight%, and the viscosity is the value measured at 25 degrees Centigrade. \\n     EXAMPLE 1 \\n     Treatment baths (a) through (f) were prepared by blending toluene siloxane A and compound B as reported in Table 1. \\n     (siloxane A)-- ##STR3## (compound B)--C 1  3 H 2  7 O(C 2  H 4  O) 3  CH 2  COOH \\n     \\n                       TABLE 1______________________________________   formulation (parts)Components     (a)     (b)     (c)   (d)   (e)   (f)______________________________________Siloxane A     9.2     9.2     9.2   9.2   9.2     0Compound B     6.3     2.1     1.0   0.2   0       0Toluene   985.5   988.7   989.8 990.6 990.8 1000molar ratio:     3       1       0.5   0.1   0     --compound B toamino groupsin siloxane A______________________________________ \\n    \\n     Fluorescent-whitened 100% cotton broadcloth (50 cm \\u00d750 cm) was immersed for 10 seconds in the particular treatment bath.

It is concerned particularly with methods and apparatus which will reduce the compression forces on the fiber web during intervals when the carding machine is stopped, so that an indentation or more highly compacted zone will not be formed in the portion of the web that is to be advanced into the carding machine upon the return of such machine to its operating condition. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     It is known for cards and cleaning machines to be supplied by means of pneumatic conveying lines with fiber flocks which are separated from the conveying air by a separator and supplied to a feed chute which is usually positioned below the separator. \\n     A chute of this kind has been described, for example, in an article entitled &#34;Die Neue Kardenspeisung Aerofeed-U&#34;, published in the February 1986 issue of the journal &#34;mittex&#34;. The article discloses that the pneumatically supplied flocks are conveyed by means of a separating head into a feed chute in which the flocks are separated from the air conveying them. \\n     The flocks are delivered from the chute by means of feed rollers and supplied by way of an opening cylinder to a second stock chute lower down, from which they are delivered by means of a pair of non-displaceable delivery rollers and, through the agency of one of the two such rollers and of another displaceable pressing roller, are conveyed further, for example, to a guide plate of a card. \\n     The pressing roller is either weight-biased or spring-biased so that resulting pressure consolidates or compresses the web at a predetermined pressure. \\n     A disadvantage can arise in connection with the use of such arrangements. When the card is stopped and delivery of the feed web ceases for a time, even though temporarily, a compressed zone is produced in the web because of the pressing between the pressing roller and the delivery roller. This zone does not return to its original shape after regular machine operations are resumed. That is, a web zone that has been compressed for a time between stationary rollers will not spring back to anything like the same extent as a web which has been fed continuously through such a compression zone. The web could be said to &#34;breathe&#34; much less in a zone compressed for a time between stationary feed means than in the rest of the web which has been compressed at the same pressure but while being conveyed continuously. \\n     Such indentations or more highly compacted zones in the fiber web being supplied to the carding instrumentalities have been found to be sources of irregularities in slivers produced by the card. Such irregularities are undesirable, particularly in systems which include automatic control systems intended to make possible the production of uniform slivers. \\n     OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     It is an object of the invention to obviate disadvantages of the type noted above. \\n     A more particular object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus which will serve to relieve the compression action exerted on a fiber web in the supply path to a fiber preparation machine during times when the web is not being advanced, so as to avoid the later presentation to the fiber preparation machine of a fiber web in which some zones are compacted to a greater extent than others. \\n     A further object is to improve the uniformity of the output of a card by methods and apparatus for avoiding the introduction, during periods of card stoppage, of irregularities in the fiber web being supplied to a card. \\n     In accordance with the invention, the supply system for a fiber preparation machine includes means which exert a compression force on a moving fiber web being fed to the machine during normal operations but such means is so controlled that the compression force is relieved when the machine is stopped. In one embodiment, for example, the web normally is pressed between two rollers but, when the advance of the web into the fiber preparation machine is stopped, one of the rollers is moved away from the other roller to free the web from the pressing action. Then, upon the resumption of web feeding, the roller which had been moved away is returned to its active position to again exert compression forces on the web as it moves along the supply path. \\n     The invention is particularly advantageous when applied in connection with the supply of cotton fibers to a card. Cotton fiber flocks from a feed chute are formed into a web whose crosssectional density may be sensed and measured on its way to the nip between the feed roller and the feed plate at the card. Through use of the present invention, undesired displacements and deflections in the inner structure of portions of the web of the occasions of machine stoppages are avoided. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention may be more fully understood from consideration of the descriptions made hereinafter with reference to the drawings, in which: \\n     FIG. 1 is a view in semi-diagrammatic form through a feed chute according to the invention, the chute being followed by a card; \\n     FIG. 2 shows a detail of the chute of FIG. 1 on the line I--I thereof; \\n     FIG. 3 shows a detail of FIG. 2 but with a further detail thereof in a different operative position; \\n     FIG. 4 shows another detail of the chute on the section line II--II of FIG. 5 and to an enlarged scale; \\n     FIG. 5 shows details of FIG. 4 looking in the direction of the line III--III of FIG. 1; \\n     FIGS. 6 and 7 each show a variant of the chute of FIG. 1; \\n     FIG. 8 is a view looking in the direction IV and on the section line V--V of the chute shown in FIG. 7; and \\n     FIG. 9 shows a variant of the detail of FIG. 4. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \\n     Referring initially to FIG. 1, fiber flocks enter the system at the upper right of this view. A separating head 3 and an exhaust air casing 4 are connected to a casing 2 of a feed chute 1. Casing 4 is connected to an exhaust air pipe 5. \\n     An air separation chute 6 extends downwardly (looking at FIG. 1) in casing 2. It is disposed below the head 3, as considered in the direction of movement of the fiber flocks, and is bounded by a perforate plate 7. \\n     The chute 6 receives a mixture of flocks and air which is conveyed by way of the head 3 into the chute 6. The flocks remain therein while the air passes through the plate 7 into an exhaust chamber 8 and therefrom by way of the casing 4 into the exhaust pipe 5. \\n     The chute 6 then comprises feed rollers 9 and an opening cylinder 10 which respectively deliver the flocks in the chute 6 and open the flocks further and deliver them to a stock chute 11. \\n     Disposed at the bottom end of the chute 11 as shown in FIG. 1 (i.e., at the exit of the chute 11 as considered in the direction of flock flow) are two non-displaceable delivery rollers 12 which are adapted to deliver the flocks from the chute 11 and which are rotatable around their axes of rotation. The rollers 12 are driven by a drive 15 indicated in chain-dotted lines. This drive comprises a chain 16, a driving wheel 17 and an idler gear 18. The chain extends around sprockets 19 (FIG. 5) on the respective delivery roller shafts in such a way that the delivery rollers rotate in opposite directions. \\n     Another roller 13 also is provided. It is displaceable. To drive this displaceable delivery roller 13, sprockets are disposed one at each end of the shafts of the delivery rollers 12 and 13; the sprockets being interconnected by a chain 20 so that the torque transmitted by the sprocket 19 to the corresponding non-displaceable roller 12 can be transmitted by the chain 20 to the displaceable roller 13. Both shafts of the non-displaceable rollers 12 have a sprocket 19. \\n     Also, each of the non-displaceable delivery rollers 12 is non-displaceably mounted by means of a pivot bearing 21 and 22 in the casing 2 while the displaceable roller 13 has its shaft mounted at both ends in pivoted links 23 and 24 (only the link 24 being visible in FIG. 4) which are pivotally received by the shaft of the roller 12 on the right as viewed in FIG. 1. The latter shaft is designated by the reference character 25. \\n     The links 23 and 24 are rigidly interconnected by way of a stirrup 26 pivotally connected by way of a pivot 27 to a pressure-operated reciprocating actuator or cylinder 14. This is pivotally connected by way of a pivot 29 to a bracket 30 rigidly secured to the casing 2 (see FIG. 4). \\n     The non-displaceable rollers 12 are separated from one another by a fixed gap or spacing A but the operative gap or spacing B between the displaceable roller 13 and the non-displaceable roller 12 opposite the same usually corresponds to the gap arising due to compression of the fiber web by the force produced by the actuator 14. The gap B is, as a rule, not fixed but corresponds to the thickness of the fiber web passing between the rollers. \\n     The displaceable roller 13 is pivotable away from the opposed roller 12, in the direction indicated by an arrow W, into a normal or inoperative position until the gap B corresponds substantially to the gap A. \\n     The actuator 14 is a single-acting pressing cylinder having a spring (not shown) for the inwards movement of plunger 31. The actuator 14 is pressurized by means of a pressure line 32 and, for the outwards movement, air is vented in the direction indicated by an arrow 33. As can be gathered from FIG. 1, the line 32 is connected to an electrically controlled single-acting 4-way 2-position diverter or valve 34. \\n     The diverter 34 is pneumatically connected by way of a line 36 to a compressed air supply 37 and electrically connected by way of a line 38 to a control 39. \\n     A pressure-reducing valve 40 can be provided in the line 32 to control the pressure for the actuator 14. In the absence of any such valve the pressure in either the line 36 or supply 37 must be controlled; alternatively, the actuator 14 is selected in accordance with a given air pressure and a required force. \\n     As can also be gathered from FIG. 1, another pressure line 41 extends to a single-acting actuator 42, the same being effective, in the absence of conveyance of flocks into the chute 6, to close an air control flap 43 closing the plate 7. The actuator 42 is not connected to the flap 43 since the same must be able to pivot in a predetermined zone for its operation. To this end, the flap 43 is connected to a balance weight 44. The function of the flap 43 has been described in the journal article previously mentioned and will therefore not be referred to further. FIG. 3 shows the flap 43 in the closed state and in engagement with the plunger rod of the actuator 42. \\n     As can also be gathered from FIG. 1, the feed chute 1 communicates by way of a guide plate 45 with a card 46. The chain-dotted-line framing around the card 46 is intended to indicate that the chute 1 can be connected to other fiber preparation or spinning plant machines supplied with fiber webs for processing. \\n     The card 46 may be of conventional construction. It comprises a feed roller 47 driven by a drive 56, a taker-in 48 driven by a drive 57, a swift 49 and associated flats 50, a doffer 51, a draw-off roller 52, a pair of crushing rollers 53, a condenser 54 and a pair of sensing rollers 55. As indicated in FIG. 1, the elements 51, 52, 53 and 55 are driven by a common drive 58. \\n     Also, the control 39 controls the drives 56, 57 and 58. Controls of this kind are known per se and need not be further described here. In the simplest case the control 39 can be understood as controlling the starting and stopping of the illustrated card drives which can in turn be part of a comprehensive card control not described herein. \\n     In operation fiber flocks go through the head 3 into the chute 6 and are conveyed therefrom by the feed roller 9 and opening cylinder 10 into the stock chute 11. The non-displaceable delivery rollers 12 then compress the flocks in the chute 11 in accordance with the gap &#34;A&#34; to form a fiber web which is conveyed by means of the rollers 12 between the displaceable delivery roller 13 and the opposed stationary delivery roller 12 and is thus pressed to become an even more condensed fiber web. The same then goes to the guide plate 45 and moves thereon to the feed roller 47 and into the card 46. \\n     If for any reason carding has to be stopped, the drives 56, 57 and 58 also are stopped, and the control 39 simultaneously resets the valve 34 so that the pressure line 32 discharges and the pressure line 41 charges up. Consequently, the displaceable delivery roller 13 pivots back into its non-operating position in the direction W and the actuator 42 closes the flap 43. \\n     However, the movement according to the invention of the displaceable delivery roller 13 from its operating position into its non-operating position is of course not dependent upon the combination with the flap 43. However, if the feed chute has a flap as shown herein or a similar flap, the combination is advantageous. \\n     Upon the resumption of carding, the valve 34 returns to its position shown in FIG. 1 so that the displaceable delivery roller 13 and the actuator 42 return to their respective operative positions. The flap 43 then is once again free to be moved by the air movements, the latter term denoting the air flow from chamber 8 into casing 4. \\n     FIG. 6 shows a feed chute 1.1 which is a variant of the chute 1 of FIG. 1 to the extent that it comprises a conveyor belt 59 around the displaceable delivery roller 13 and the associated non-displaceable delivery roller 12, so that the conveyor belt 59 conveys the fiber web being compressed and fed toward the card. The stirrup 26 engages over the conveyor belt 59, as indicated in FIG. 4 by the chain-dotted-line representation of the conveyor belt 59. \\n     Consequently, the driving chain 20 and the chain-receiving sprockets (not shown) can be omitted since the displaceable roller 13 can be driven from the non-displaceable roller 12 by way of the conveyor belt 59. Alternatively, the chain and associated sprockets can be retained and the conveyor belt 59 need not be relied upon to provide a drive function. \\n     All the other elements of the chute 1.1 correspond to those of the chute 1 and so need not be further described. \\n     FIG. 7 shows a feed chute 1.2 which is a variant of the chute 1 of FIG. 1 to the extent that the stock chute 11.1 of FIG. 7 is formed by a conveyor belt 60, a conveyor belt 61 opposite the same and two end walls 62 (only one end wall 62 being visible in FIG. 7). \\n     The conveyor belt 60 is non-displaceable and the conveyor belt 61 is arranged for pivoting around a pivot 63. The same is also the pivot for the reversing roller 64 which is at the top in FIG. 7. \\n     As can be gathered from FIG. 7, the bottom reversing rollers of the conveyor belts 60, 61 are driven in the same way as the non-displaceable rollers 12 except that the idler gear 18 of the drive 15 must be able to receive the movements of the pivoted belt 61. \\n     The reversing rollers of the belt 61 are interconnected at their ends by links 70 and 71 (FIG. 8) in the same way as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 with respect to the pivoted links 23 and 24. The connecting links 70 and 71 are connected to a stirrup 28 similar to the stirrup 26 of FIG. 4, and the reciprocating actuator 14.1 can be pivotally secured to the stirrup 28. The actuator 14.1 is pivotally secured to the casing 2 and connected to the pressure line 32 in exactly the same way as the actuator 14 of FIG. 4. \\n     Due to the pivoting feature of the conveyor belt 61, the bottom reversing roller thereof can, just like the displaceable delivery roller 13, be pivoted towards the bottom reversing roller of the belt 60, to bring the belt 61 into the operative position, and can pivot the belt 61 back into its inoperative normal position when carding stops to relieve the compression exerted on the fiber web by the opposed lower end portions of the belts. \\n     FIG. 8 shows, on the left of each of the conveyor belts 60 and 61 as they are seen in FIG. 8, a sprocket 19.1 corresponding to the sprocket 19 of FIG. 5. A sprocket 19.1 is provided on each of the two bottom shafts of the belts 60 and 61, there being visible on the right-hand side thereof a chain 20.1 which cooperates with a corresponding sprocket (not shown) to drive the top reversing roller unless the same is driven by the belt itself. \\n     FIG. 8 shows only the non-displaceable conveyor belt 60. As will be apparent, the two free ends of the shaft of the top reversing roller are disposed one each in a bearing 65 secured to the casing 2, and the ends of the shaft of the bottom reversing roller are rotatably mounted in bearings 66 secured in the casing 2. Also, of course, the shaft of the top reversing roller of the belt 61 has its two free ends rotatably mounted in bearings in the casing 2 just like the shaft of the reversing roller of the belt 60, while the shaft of the bottom reversing roller of the belt 61 is rotatably mounted in the links 70 and 71. \\n     FIG. 9 shows another variant wherein the non-displaceable delivery roller 12 shown on the right of FIG. 4 is omitted and the displaceable delivery roller 13 is mounted for pivoting around the pivot 67. To this end, shaft 68 of the displaceable roller 13 is mounted for rotation in a swivel plate 69 pivotally connected to the actuator 14.2 which is pivotably mounted on the casing 2. \\n     The displaceable roller 13 has a gear 19 thereon like the gear on the non-displaceable roller 12, and the chain 16 of the drive 15 extends around the sprockets, as shown in chain-dotted lines in FIG. 9, in order to drive the displaceable roller 13 in a direction of rotation opposite to that of the non-displaceable roller 12. The other elements are the same and correspondingly have like references. The stock chute 11.1 is adapted, as compared with the feed chute 11, to suit the swivel plate 69. \\n     Although several embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in detail, further embodiments will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. Moreover, while the new fiber web supply system is especially advantageous in combination with a card, it also can be combined with other fiber preparation machinery into which a fiber web has to be fed. Accordingly, the foregoing descriptions are to be understood as illustrative only, and the scope of the invention is to be ascertained from the following claims.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7106,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"An optical position monitor for determining the position of a latch needle ( 104 ) in a knitting machine is provided that comprises: at least one fiducial ( 102 ) at a known fixed cation on the body of the latch needle; a fiducial imager that produces at least one optical image ( 262 ) of the at least one fiducial on at least one light sensitive surface ( 260 ) wherein the at least one optical image changes with changes in position of said at least one fiducial; and a controller that receives at least one signal responsive to the changes in the at least one image and uses the at least one signal to determine the position of the at least one fiducial ( 102 ) and thereby of the latch needle ( 104 ).\",\n          \"A composition for fabricating phase-change-material microcapsule and a method for fabricating microcapsule are provided.

The user began to operate with a glass container, somehow a glass break detector, if any, was needed by manufacturers to know whether the glass container was broken a little or not, in view of the fractures or cracks happened to occur on the glassware due to impacts or collisions. Density-dependent factors such as to expand when hot to shrink when cold also caused the glass surfaces to expand or shrink disproportionately and then cracks began to occur. Persons skilled in the art provided reinforced plastic such as acrylic resin to manufacture the container of the blender instead of the glassware. Because the reinforced plastic was not only light weight but also cost efficient, durable and rigid, they were attractive raw materials cherished by the manufacturers and consumers. But the containers made of reinforced plastic, during longer time period usage, the inner wall was impacted or collided intermittently by the stirred objects, eventually it resulted in nicks. Debris of the scraped acrylic resin was possibly mixed into the liquid. Once the debris remained in the liquid got drunk by consumers led to a poor hygiene condition. In fact the manufacturers provided a container made simply from a reinforced plastic hardly complied with all hygienic rules. The inventors of the present invention encounter the problems as mentioned above, provide a metal lining (cylindrical member) to shield the inner wall of the receptacle, which is known by their patent document 1.  \\n         [0004]     Patent Document 1: TW580,899 entitled \\u201ccontainer for blender\\u201d assigned to the inventors Kou-I Ling and Rong-Yuan Tseng of the present invention on 21 Mar. 2004, the same is also patented in the USA assigned patent number as U.S. Pat. No. 6,786,440 on 7 Sep. 2004.  \\n       DISCUSSION ABOUT PRIOR ARTS  \\n       [0005]     As shown in  FIG. 1 , a conventional blender having a cup ( 1 ), a set of blades ( 3 ) installed within the base of cup ( 1 ). When blades ( 3 ) are rotated in high speed, the vegetable and fruit will be grated until they become liquid as well as a whirlpool is formed in the receptacle, which is illustrated and indicated by spiral arrows as shown in  FIG. 2 . But the whirlpool ( 4 ) in usual brings the rough and long fibers ( 41 ) to the outer circle in contact with the inner wall by centrifugal force. In other words, by centrifugation the rough and long fibers ( 41 ) is not swirl into the center of the whirlpool ( 4 ) but whirl around the outer circle thereof. Some rough and long fibers ( 41 ) are neither brought to the lower portion of the cup ( 1 ) by whirlpool ( 4 ) nor further being grated by the blades ( 3 ). It could not catch one&#39;s sense when drinking juice with rough and long fibers are not liquefied efficiently. A spoon may be inserted into the whirlpool ( 4 ) or the stirring time is prolonged to grate the rough and long fibers. As a result, for a longer time period, the grated fibers immersed in the liquid are stirred to a foam with bubbles, this \\u201coxidization\\u201d activity exposed in the air is going to influence the bright color and luster of the juice. The nutrition will be lost; the active fiber basis vitamins will be destroyed. The same problems happened to occur in the cited patent document 1. Accordingly, a metal lining combined to the inner wall of the cup ( 1 ) as a shield reduces the stirring time for promptly providing juice catches the user&#39;s sense. That is the key point of the present invention.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0006]     Accordingly, the present invention is aimed to provide a container of the blender comprises a cup ( 1 ) and a lining ( 2 ) disposed inside the cup ( 1 ) characterized in that the lining ( 2 ) is formed as a shield inside the cup ( 1 ), a number of teeth ( 21 ) projected from the inner wall of the lining ( 2 ) for grinding the fibers of vegetable and fruit.  \\n         [0007]     The lining ( 2 ) is selected from one of the following: metal lining, glass lining, lining has approximately the same hardness.  \\n         [0008]     Several vertical ribs ( 11 ) projected from the inner wall of the cup ( 1 ), several vertical stopper members ( 22 ) formed on the inner wall of the lining ( 2 ) which are corresponding to the vertical ribs ( 11 ), the ribs ( 11 ) are received into the hollowed trough of the stopper members ( 22 ).  \\n         [0009]     A number of teeth ( 21 \\u2032) are arranged on and projected up from the top end of the stopper members.  \\n         [0010]     The rib ( 11 ) has a vertical facet ( 111 ), and the stopper member  22  has a vertical facet ( 221 ).  \\n         [0011]     The lining ( 2 ) is selected from one of the following: half-mask, whole mask.  \\n         [0012]     The half-mask lining is combined to the cup ( 1 ) by injection modeling.  \\n         [0013]     The half-mask lining is mounted inside the cup ( 1 ), the top rim of the lining ( 2 ) has lip ( 26 ).  \\n         [0014]     The half-mask lining is mounted inside the cup ( 1 ), several prop stands ( 24 ) extended from the top rim of the lining ( 2 ), a horizontal ring is connected to the top portion of the prop stands ( 24 ).  \\n         [0015]     The half-mask lining is mounted inside the cup ( 1 ), the top rim of the lining ( 2 ) has horizontal ring extended radially outwardly.  \\n         [0016]     The lining ( 2 ) is selected from one of the following: integrally formed as a whole annular lining, a number of lining pieces ( 2   a ), or ( 2   b ) combined to form an annular lining.  \\n         [0017]     The first facet of the stopper member ( 22 ) is bended inward to form a buckled piece ( 222 ), the buckled piece ( 222 ) leads into a groove ( 113 ) defined on the first facet of the rib ( 11 ), the second facet of the lining pieces ( 22 ) is a flat facet directly leads into a trench ( 112 ) defined on the second facet of the rib ( 11 ) of the cup ( 1 ).  \\n       EFFECTS AND MECHANISMS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION  \\n       [0018]     The advantages can be achieved from practicing of the present invention as following:  \\n         [0019]     The rigid lining ( 2 ) shields the inner wall of the receptacle from collision of rigid material, but the fibers remained in the teeth ( 21 ) on the inner wall of the lining can be ground and cut into pieces.

The lining ( 2 ) is a prefabricated component combined to the cup ( 1 ) by injection molding. In other words, the lining ( 2 ) is first placed in the mode and then a transparent or translucent acrylic cup ( 1 ) is formed to wrap over the circumference of the lining ( 2 ) integrally as a whole by injection molding; finally, they are never detached from each other.  \\n         [0034]     Lining ( 2 ) is shaped as a half-mask, that is, the lining ( 2 ) only shields the lower half portion of the cup ( 1 ) but the upper half portion of the cup ( 1 ) is not shielded by the lining ( 2 ). Users can see vegetable or fruit cubes are whipped or thrashed in the cup ( 1 ). If the lining ( 2 ) is shaped as a whole-mask (as shown in  FIG. 13 ), the upper and lower half portions of the cup are shielded by the lining ( 2 ). Users only look down on the vegetable or fruit cubes whipped or thrashed in the cup ( 1 ).  \\n         [0035]     Lining ( 2 ) is combined to the inner wall of the cup ( 1 ) to form a shield screen characterized in that a number of teeth ( 21 ) projected from the inner wall of the lining ( 2 ) applied to grate fibers of vegetable and fruit. Teeth ( 21 ) can be arranged in parallel with one another, but they are all arrayed in alignment with each other finally to form a crossed or columned shape of teeth array. Rather, the lining ( 2 ) can be made of metal, glass, alloy, or non-alloy material, which is with a hardness rather rigid than the acrylic cup ( 1 ). Lining ( 2 ) is an annular member formed integrally as a whole one, but which is preferred in the shape of polygon. A lining base ( 21 ) can be added to the bottom of the cap ( 1 ) as a shield screen thereof. The top end of the lining ( 2 ) has an L type wall ( 25   a ) bended outward and upward, the bottom end of the lining ( 2 ) has an L type wall ( 25   b ) bended inward and downward respectively. Both L type walls ( 25   a ,  25   b ) are embedded into the inner wall of the cup ( 1 ) to eliminate the permeation of liquid through a chink on the wall.  \\n         [0036]     Cup ( 1 ) has a handle ( 12 ) and a spout ( 13 ). Several vertical ribs ( 11 ) are protruded from the inner wall of the cup ( 1 ); several vertical stopper members ( 22 ) corresponding to the ribs ( 11 ) are also formed on the obverse side of the wall of the lining ( 2 ), hollowed troughs opposed to the stopper members ( 22 ) are formed on the reverse side of the wall of the lining ( 2 ), the hollowed troughs are suitable for matching up and receiving the vertical rib ( 11 ).  \\n         [0037]     As shown in  FIG. 6 , look down on the cup ( 1 ), and the lining ( 2 ), a facet ( 111 ) of the rib ( 11 ) and a facet ( 221 ) of the stopper members ( 22 ) can be formed as perpendicular spoilers which dampen vibration of the vegetable and fruit fibers (as shown in  FIG. 7 ) but sweep them in the whirlpool ( 4 ) as much as possible to the center thereof; and then to the lower half portion of the cup ( 1 ) being crumbled by the straight blades. But only a few rough and long fibers ( 41 ) are forced into the center of the whirlpool, most of them still left outside the inner circle of the whirlpool ( 4 ).  \\n         [0038]     As shown in  FIG. 7 , when the straight blades (not shown) is rotated in high speed, rough and long fibers ( 41 ) in the whirlpool ( 4 ) remained in the teeth ( 21 ) on the surrounding inner wall of the lining ( 2 ) will soon be grated and chopped into pieces. Possibility of the rough and long fibers being grated is greatly improved. Though the fibers all are not easily forced into the whirlpool center at once, they can be chopped into pieces by the teeth ( 21 ) as well. Therefore, the duration for the blender stirring the chopped fibers is reduced; meanwhile, possibility of oxidization of the stirred juice is also reduced. Rather, the top end of the stopper members ( 22 ) has a number of teeth ( 21 \\u2032) projected up thereof, by means of the projected teeth ( 21 \\u2032), the fibers of vegetable and fruit can be further grated and chopped into pieces. The teeth ( 21 \\u2032) projected up from the top end of the stopper members ( 22 ) are advantageous to the grinding.  \\n       Second Embodiment  \\n       [0039]     As shown in  FIG. 8 , the container of the blender includes a cup ( 1 ), and a rigid lining ( 2 ) mounted inside the cup ( 1 ). First, each of the cup ( 1 ) and lining ( 2 ) are prefabricated components, and then the lining ( 2 ) is mounted inside the cup ( 1 ) and combined to the cup ( 1 ) integrally as a whole. After combination, the assembled view of the container is illustrated as shown in  FIG. 9 .  \\n         [0040]     The lining ( 2 ) is shaped as a half-mask. But several prop stands ( 23 ) extended from the top rim of the hood ( 2 ) to a height adjacent to the top rim of the cup ( 1 ), a horizontal ring ( 24 ) is connected to the top ends of the prop stands ( 23 ). The horizontal ring ( 24 ) is convenient for the users to hold, and when the lining ( 2 ) is mounted inside the cup ( 1 ), the horizontal ring ( 24 ) placed on the L-shape (i.e. like a top step of a ladder) top rim of the container which is suitable for a lid (not shown) capped over the container, then the horizontal ring ( 24 ) is sandwiched between the container and the lid. Therefore the lining ( 2 ) can be mounted inside the container without any movements.  \\n       Third Embodiment  \\n       [0041]     As shown in  FIG. 10 , the container of the blender includes a cup ( 1 ), and a rigid lining ( 2 ) mounted inside the cup ( 1 ). The cup ( 1 ) and the lining ( 2 ) are prefabricated separately, and then the lining ( 2 ) is embedded into the cup ( 1 ) and combined to the cup ( 1 ) integrally as a whole. After combination, the assembled view is illustrated as shown in  FIG. 11 .  \\n         [0042]     The lining ( 2 ) is shaped as a half mask, which is composed of a number of lining pieces ( 2   a ). A stopper member ( 22 ) is formed on the obverse side of the lining piece ( 2   a ) as well as the teeth ( 21 ) are arrayed on the same side. The first facet of the stopper member ( 22 ) is bended inward to form a buckled piece ( 222 ). A groove ( 113 ) is defined on the first facet of the rib ( 11 ) of the cup ( 1 ), the buckled piece ( 222 ) can be led into the groove ( 113 ) in place and then the rib ( 11 ) enclosed inside the hollowed trough formed on the reverse side of the stopper member ( 22 ). The second facet of the lining pieces ( 22 ) is a flat facet directly leads into a trench ( 112 ) defined on the second facet of the rib ( 11 ) of the cup ( 1 ). A number of teeth ( 21 \\u2032) can also be arranged on the top end of stopper member ( 22 ). Rather, the lip ( 26 ) is extended radially outwardly from the top rim of the lining pieces ( 2   a ) is convenient for the user to hold when the lining pieces ( 2   a ) are assembled or disassembled with each other.  \\n       Fourth Embodiment  \\n       [0043]     As shown in  FIG. 12 , the container of the blender includes a cup ( 1 ), and a rigid lining ( 2 ) mounted inside the cup ( 1 ). The cup ( 1 ) and the lining ( 2 ) are prefabricated components. The lining ( 2 ) is embedded into the cup ( 1 ) and then combined to the cup ( 1 ) integrally as a whole. After combination, the assembled view is illustrated as shown in  FIG. 13 .  \\n         [0044]     The lining ( 2 ) is shaped as a whole mask. The lining ( 2 ) is composed of a number of lining pieces ( 2   b ), but the top rim of the lining ( 2 ) is bended outward to form a horizontal ring ( 27 ). The horizontal ring ( 27 ) is not only convenient for the user to hold to assemble or disassemble the lining pieces ( 2   b ), but the horizontal ring ( 27 ) can be placed on the top step of the ladder like top rim of the container so as the horizontal ring ( 27 ) can be sandwiched between the cup ( 1 ) and the lid (not shown) without any movements.\",\n          \"This is a division of application Ser. No. 465,354 filed Feb. 9, 1983 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,523,695. \\n    \\n    \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates to a surgical stapler for applying staples to suture or close a wound or incision, particularly a surgical skin stapler for implanting skin staples in or through the skin to suture an exterior wound or incision. \\n     Surgical staplers are used for closing or connecting conformed wound edges of tissue by implanting metal staples in the tissue. By actuation of a lever, the staple is pressed by a ram or driver against an anvil surface provided at the tip of the stapler tool and is thereby deformed, so that the parts of the staple protruding from the stapler tip are moved toward each other and penetrate into the tissue. \\n     U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,057 discloses a surgical stapler comprising a staple magazine containing a supply of staples, a spring for advancing the staples in the staple magazine, an anvil surface provided at the stapler tip, and a driver displaceable relative to the anvil surface in a staple channel which deforms a staple supported on the anvil surface. In a stapler of the type disclosed in the aforementioned patent, the staples are advanced along a straight feed path in the staple magazine. The forwardmost staple lies in the path of movement of the driver which extends at an angle which appears to be about 50\\u00b0 with respect to the longitudinal axis of the staple magazine. The stapler is actuated in plier fashion to advance the driver which presses the forwardmost staple protruding from the stapler tip against the anvil surface and deforms it to close the staple side portions. At this point, the staple has been implanted and it is necessary to remove from the staple the anvil surface which is fixed to the stapler tip. However, if the stapler has been improperly positioned, it is possible to pull the closed staple out of the tissue when disengaging the anvil surface from the implanted staple. \\n     U.S. Pat. No. 4,202,480 discloses a surgical stapler which also comprises a staple magazine having a straight staple feed path. The staple channel in the stapler in which the driver is displaceable and the staple magazine meet at almost a right angle. The forwardmost staple is advanced by the driver to the anvil surface on which it is deformed with its side portions protruding forwardly of the stapler tip. The anvil surface is transversely disposed at the forward end of the staple channel. It is also difficult to pull the anvil surface of this stapler out of an implanted staple. \\n     U.S. Pat. No. 3,819,100 discloses a surgical stapler comprising a removable staple cartridge which is inserted into and locked to the stapler. The staple cartridge has a straight staple feed path. Staples are advanced by a driver moved by a stepping mechanism. The forward housing portion of the stapler, into which the staple cartridge is inserted, is rotatable relative to the rear housing portion. The anvil surface is fixed at the front end of the staple cartridge. \\n     Prior art surgical staplers have the disadvantage that they did not afford a good view of the work area because the driver moved transversely to the straight staple magazine. Therefore when the stapler was positioned for use, a considerable portion of the work area was obscured. While it is possible to arrange and feed the staples laying flat one behind the other in order provide a slim tool tip affording a better view of the work area, the cost of manufacturing the parts required to accomplish this is high. Moreover, the number of staples that can be accommodated in a staple magazine if the staples lie flat one behind the other is relatively small. \\n     OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     It is an object of the present invention to provide a surgical stapler, particularly a skin stapler, which eliminates the possiblity of tearing an implanted staple out of the tissue or substantially disturbing it when the anvil is separated from the staple, particularly if the stapler was improperly positioned. \\n     The above and other objects are achieved according to the invention disclosed herein which provides a surgical stapler having an anvil surface or nose movable transversely with respect to a staple channel between an operating position and a retracted position, and in which movement of the anvil surface is controlled as a function of the position of a driver in the staple channel which cooperates with the anvil surface to deform a staple. \\n     According to the invention, movement of the anvil surface is coupled with that of the driver. When the die is moved into its operating position, the anvil surface is also automatically brought into its operating position in which it protrudes into the staple channel in which the driver moves. Advancement of the staple in the channel is stopped by the anvil surface, and deformation of the staple takes place between the anvil surface and the driver. When the die is subsequently retracted, the anvil surface moves automatically into its retracted position, so that the closed staple does not interfere with removal of the stapler instrument. According to the invention, the anvil surface and the driver are brought into their operating positions together, the driver moving longitudinally in the staple channel while the anvil moves transversely to the staple channel. \\n     Further objects of the present invention are to provide a stapler, particularly a skin stapler, whose tool tip is narrow and in which the staples are arranged and fed upright one against the other so that the staple magazine including the advancing mechanism can be relatively simple and yet the tool tip can be narrow, thereby covering up as little of the work area as possible. These and other objects are achieved in accordance with the invention by providing a staple magazine which extends essentially parallel to the staple channel and having at its forward end a curved section opening into the staple channel. \\n     According to the invention, the staples are disposed in the magazine parallel to each other standing upright so that the side and the base or crown portions of adjacent staples are in contact, and are advanced by a spring. Since the forward end of the staple magazine is curved where the staple magazine opens into the staple channel, the forwardmost staple enters the staple channel in which the driver moves lying flat in the staple channel. When the die is moved to its operating position, it blocks the opening of the magazine into the staple channel so that the next staple can be advanced into the channel only after the driver has been brought back into its retracted position. Therefore, only the forwardmost staple in the magazine can be engaged by the driver as the driver is moved past the magazine opening. \\n     According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the anvil surface is fastened to a leaf spring which extends in the staple channel and includes an inclined surface. The driver includes a projection which cooperates with the inclined surface so that when the projection strikes the inclined surface, the leaf spring is deformed in such a way that the anvil surface is brought into its operating position. Upon release of the driver, the tension of the deformed leaf spring is released to automatically return the anvil surface into its retracted position. \\n     For skin staplers precise guiding of the staple during the staple closing process is very important because the staple is closed as it emerges from the staple channel at the tip of the tool. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a notch or slot for retaining the base or crown portion of the staple during the deformation process is disposed in the anvil surface. In the initial phase of deformation, a projection or bulge in the base of the staple penetrates into the notch or slot, so that the staple is prevented from turning or pivoting. Preferably the notch or slot is located in the center of the anvil surface and the projection or bulge is symmetrically disposed in the staple. The notch or slot edges preferably dig into the staple and bring about an interlocking of the staple and the anvil surface in the central portion of the base region of the staple. \\n     According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the staple channel comprises side, upper and lower guide surfaces which limit movement of the forwardmost staple as it is advanced lying flat in the staple channel. The guide surfaces extend forwardly to beyond the anvil surface. An embossment positions the forwardmost staple in the staple channel upon being advanced from the magazine. From there, as the driver is advanced towards its operating position, the staple is transported to the anvil surface and feeding of additional staples from the magazine is blocked. The guide surfaces provide a well-defined advance of a staple in the channel. Preferably the guide surfaces are extended in projections of relatively small dimensions protruding forwardly beyond the anvil surface. \\n     A two-part housing comprising a rear housing portion and a front housing portion which is rotatable relative to the rear housing portion facilitates use of the stapler. The rear housing portion contains the actuating mechanism for the driver and the front housing portion contains the driver and anvil surface which are rotatable together with the front housing portion relative to the rear housing portion. By making the front housing portion rotatable relative to the rear housing portion, the orientation of the staple relative to the actuating mechanism can be selected freely. Hence the physician need not align the actuating mechanism transversely to the wound or incision seam but can hold the instrument in the position most favorable for working the instrument. \\n     It is important that the stapler be actuated with little effort since the instrument can only be held steady and firmly, which is required for precise setting of the staples, if the staples can be deformed and implanted with little physical force. To achieve this, the actuating element of the actuating mechanism and a lever in the rear housing portion, and the driver are coupled in such a way that the effective leverage of the lever increases as the actuating element moves further away from its inoperative position while at the same time the advancing force transmitted to the driver increases for a constant actuating force at the actuating element. In the first phase of actuation of the actuating element, the forwardmost staple of the staple magazine is simply advanced in the staple channel until it reaches the anvil surface. In this first phase the force required is relatively low. However, the maximum force that is available is required when the staple is being deformed and this maximum force occurs when the actuating element reaches its maximum travel. The amount of force required to deform the staple is reduced by the actuating mechanism disclosed herein so that it is possible to deform the staple simply by moving the actuating element with one&#39;s index finger. Compared with known staplers, the actuating force required to operate the stapler disclosed herein is reduced by about one half. \\n     It is possible to positively couple the movement of the driver with the lengthwise movement of a slide coupled to the actuating element. However such coupling of the driver to the actuating element would be disadvantageous because the driver would follow every movement of the slide and it is possible that a second staple could enter the channel without the first staple having been deformed and released if the driver is not fully advanced to its operating position. To avoid this, according to the invention, the driver and slide are not positively coupled. Instead means are provided so that the driver is not retracted by the slide unless the driver has been advanced to its operating position. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a slide coupled to the actuating element is provided which includes a tongue loaded with a transverse spring action which cooperates with a control cam disposed in the housing. The tongue includes a surface which is positioned against a transverse edge of the driver and permits the driver to be retracted only after the driver has been advanced fully into its operating position. Only then can the driver be retracted and the opening of the staple magazine into the channel cleared so that the next staple can be advanced. \\n     According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a counting mechanism is provided which is advanced by a projection on the tongue of the slide. The counting mechanism indicates the number of staples used or the number of staples remaining in the magazine. \\n     The above and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the invention will be more readily perceived from the following description of the preferred embodiments thereof when considered with the accompanying drawings and appended claims. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like numerals indicate similar parts and in which: \\n     FIG. 1 is a schematic, longitudinal section view taken through a stapler according to the invention; \\n     FIG. 2 is a longitudinal section view taken through the tip portion of the stapler of FIG. 1 depicting the anvil surface in its retracted position; \\n     FIG. 3 is a view similar to that of FIG. 2 depicting the anvil surface in its operating position; \\n     FIG. 4 is a section taken along line IV--IV of FIG. 2; \\n     FIG. 5 is a section along line V--V of FIG. 3; \\n     FIG. 6 is a vertical section view taken through the magazine portion of the stapler of FIG. 1; \\n     FIG. 7 is a side schematic view of a portion of the stapler of FIG. 1 illustrating the cooperation of the slide of the actuating mechanism and the driver as the driver is advanced; \\n     FIG. 8 is a side schematic view similar to that of FIG. 7 illustrating the cooperation of the slide and the driver of the stapler of FIG. 1 shortly before the driver is retracted; \\n     FIG. 9 is a plan schematic view of structure depicted in FIG. 8; \\n     FIG. 10 is a vertical section view of a stapler tip including a counting mechanism according to another embodiment of the invention; \\n     FIG. 11 is a vertical section view of a part of the rear housing of a stapler according to another embodiment of the invention depicting the actuating mechanism thereof in the retracted position of the slide; and \\n     FIG. 12 is a view similar to that of FIG. 11 depicting the actuating mechanism in the feed position of the slide. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \\n     Preferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated and described in connection with a stapler for applying staples to an exterior wound or incision across a layer of skin, although the invention is not limited to such a surgical stapler. \\n     The embodiment of the stapler illustrated in FIGS. 1-9 comprises as depicted in FIG. 1 a rear housing portion 10 and a front housing portion 11. The front housing portion 11 is mounted to the rear housing position for rotation of the front housing portion about its longitudinal axis. The mechanism 12 for actuating the stapler is contained in the rear housing portion 11. A slide 13 which advances a driver 15 is guided in the front housing portion 10 for longitudinal displacement but is prevented from rotating. The slide 13 comprises a forwardly projecting flexible tongue 14 which also cooperates with the driver 15, as described more fully below. The driver 15 comprises an elongated rigid strip of material which is displaceable in its longitudinal direction in a channel or duct 16. The strip has a central recess 17 (FIG. 4) at the forward end of which is disposed a bent-up section 18 having an enlarged head. \\n     A leaf spring 19 extends in the channel 16 substantially parallel to the driver 15. The leaf spring 19 has an inclined surface 20 (FIG. 2) and is provided with a central slot 21 (FIG. 4) closed on all sides which extends forwardly and rearwardly of the region of the inclined surface 20. The enlarged head of the bent section 18 of the driver 15 protrudes through the slot 21 and is pressed against the upper side of the leaf spring 19. The forward end of the leaf spring 19 is bent downwardly to form the anvil surface 22. The rear end of leaf spring 19 is fixed to the front housing portion 11. \\n     When the driver 15 is in its retracted position, as depicted in FIG. 2, the bent section 18 is positioned at the base of the inclined surface 20. Due to the inherent tension in the front region of the leaf spring 19, the leaf spring positions itself in the channel 16 as depicted in FIG. 2. Since the height of the channel 16 is greater than the height of the anvil 22, there is a clearance between the anvil 22 in its retracted position and the lower region 16&#39; at the front of the channel 16. \\n     A staple magazine 26 (FIGS. 1 and 6) extends parallel to the channel 16 in the front housing portion 11. Staples 24 are arranged in the magazine standing upright side by side and extending along the feed passage of the magazine parallel to the channel 16. A helical spring 25 braced against the housing contacts the rearmost staple and urges the rearmost staple and with it the entire stack of staples forward under constant tension. The forward section 26&#39; of the staple magazine 26 is curved upwardly at an angle of 90\\u00b0 and opens into the channel 16. The staples are urged into the curved section 26&#39; of the magazine and extend along the arc of the curve as depicted in FIG. 6, with the forwardmost staple 24&#39; being disposed lying flat in the channel 16. The lower region 16&#39; in the forward portion of the channel 16 in which the leaf spring 19 can move vertically is of greater width than the region above it. The height of the wider, lower channel portion 16&#39; is only slightly greater than the thickness of the staples 24 so that channel portion 16&#39;  forms a guide channel for the advance of the forwardmost staple 24&#39; and for the driver 15. This guide channel is defined by the lower guide face 16a, the two upper guide faces 16b, (FIG. 6), and by the lateral guide faces 16c  (FIG. 4). \\n     The staples 24, whose undeformed configuration is depicted in broken lines by the staple 24&#39; in FIG. 5, have arcuate side portions 24a connected via a straight leg region 24b to a central base or crown portion 24c. The straight leg regions 24b extend obliquely outwardly from the base portion to the side portions 24a. The base portion 24c is semicircular with the circumference of the semicircle facing in the direction of the side portions. The base portion is engaged by the anvil surface 22 during forward motion of the staple. In order to insure centering of the staple 24, the anvil surface 22 is provided with a vertical slot 22&#39;. \\n     In the arcuate section 26&#39; of the staple magazine 26, the side portions 24a of adjacent staples 24 are spaced apart while the straight leg regions 24b are in contact with adjacent leg regions due to the difference in radii of the curves for the upper and lower surfaces of the arcuate section 26&#39;. Thus, the force of the spring 25 can be transmitted through the staples in the arcuate section 26&#39; to the forwardmost staple 24&#39;. \\n     At the opening 27 (FIG. 5) of the magazine 26 into the channel 16, the underside of the upper guide face 16b is embossed (not shown) to hold the forwardmost staple 24&#39; in a well-defined position. As the driver 15 is advanced from retracted position shown in FIG. 2; its front end abuts the forwardmost staple 24&#39; and pushes it forward in the channel section 16&#39;. At the same time, the bent section 18 moves along the inclined surface 20 of the leaf spring 19 so that the anvil surface 22 at the forward end of the leaf spring is brought from its retracted position into the operative position shown in FIG. 3. The staple designated 24&#34; in FIGS. 3 and 4 is now situated between the forward end of driver 15 and the anvil surface 22 in a position in which the tips of the staple side portions protrude slightly forwardly from the instrument. As the driver 15 is advanced further, the staple side portions emerge from the front end of the instrument, with staple 24&#34; being deformed and closed to the solid line configuration depicted in FIG. 5 in which the base 24c of the staple has been bent flat on the inner side of the anvil surface 22. To obtain as long a guide path as possible during deformation of staple 24&#34;, the guide faces 16a, 16b and 16c extend into projections 28 which define the exit gap of channel 16 out of the housing and which protrude slightly beyond the anvil surface 22. \\n     As soon as the driver 15 has carried the forwardmost staple 24&#39; away from the opening 27 of the magazine into the channel, the opening 27 is closed by the driver so that the next staple cannot be advanced into the channel 16. The next staple can only be advanced into the channel after the driver 15 has returned to its retracted position where it is clear of the opening 27. \\n     FIGS. 7-9 illustrate control of the driver 15 by the slide 13. Slide 13, which is supported to the front housing portion 11 for longitudinal displacement but is prevented from rotating, comprises at its forward end a forwardly projecting, flexible tongue 14 which is vertically springloaded. A laterally projecting guide wing or cam surface 30 is disposed at the end of the tongue 14 and cooperates with a control cam 31 fixed to the housing portion 11. \\n     When the slide 13 is advanced by the actuating mechanism 12, its front face strikes driver 15, pushing it in the direction of the tool tip. A bevel formed on wing 30 causes wing 30 to abut on a rearward bevel of the control cam 31. The tongue 14 then flexes upwardly and wing 30 slides on the upper cam surface 32. If the slide 13 is retracted before its forward end position is reached corresponding to the operating position of the driver, the wing 30 slides back on to the upper cam surface 32, which maintains the slide and correspondingly the driver in the advanced position they assumed. Only after the slide 13 reaches the position shown in FIG. 8 and the wing 30 has gone beyond the front end of the control cam 31 is the stamping operating completed and staple 24&#34; closed. As the slide 13 is thereafter being moved back, the rear surface of the wing 30, which is inclined, contacts the correspondingly inclined forward surface of the control cam 31. As a result, the tongue 14 is forced downward, and a projection of the tongue 14 enters into the slot 17 of the driver 15. As the slide 13 is further retracted, the wing 30 is pulled beneath the control cam 31, and the driver 15 is drawn rearward. Referring to FIG. 7, after the wing 30 has passed along the underside of the control cam 31, the tongue 14 springs upward, releasing the driver 15 at its starting position. Until the driver 15 is pulled back to its starting position, it does not clear the opening 27 of the staple magazine 26 into the channel 16. \\n     FIG. 10 depicts an embodiment in which a counting mechanism 33 is secured to the front housing portion 11. The counting mechanism is stepped by movement of the tongue 14 of the slide 13. The counting mechanism 33 comprises a hollow cylinder 34 fixed in the housing portion 11 in which is rotatably mounted a cylinder 35 having ratchet teeth 36 disposed about the periphery of the lower end thereof. A projection 37 disposed at the front end of tongue 14 engages the teeth 36 when the wing 30 is raised by the guide cam 31 during a feed movement. In this manner the cylinder 35 is rotated towards the forward end of the instrument by a predetermined angle with each feed movement of the driver 15. The top of the cylinder 35 is provided with a mark and the periphery of the hollow cylinder 34 is provided with a scale so that the mark indicates on the scale the number of staples 24 remaining in the magazine 26. \\n     At the rear end of the front housing portion 11 is disposed a cylindrical bushing 40 (FIG. 1) in which slide 13 is coaxially mounted. The cylindrical bushing 40 can be removed from the rear housing portion 10 so that the magazine can be loaded with staples. The rear end of the slide 13 is coupled to a part 39 slidably movable along a track 42 in the interior of the rear housing portion 10. The sliding part 39 includes a sleeve 43 disposed about a shank 44 of the slide 13 which is bounded on both sides by flanges. The sliding part 39 is provided with a rack 45 having teeth or serrations which are engaged by corresponding serrations on a toothed disc segment 46. The toothed disc segment 46 forms one lever arm of a two-armed lever which pivots about a pivot pin 47 in the housing portion 10. The other lever arm 48 is engaged by a pin 49 disposed in a transverse slot 50 of a trigger lever 51. The trigger 51 is guided in a recess 52 of the handle 53 extending approximately parallel to channel 16, and is urged outwardly of the handle by a spring 54. Trigger 51 is dimensioned so that it can be actuated with the index finger when the handle 53 is gripped. The trigger, upon being pushed into the handle 53, causes the lever 46, 48 to be pivoted about the pivot pin 47 so that the sliding part 39 is advanced forwardly, and with it slide 13. Near the end position of the lever 46, 48 where it extends almost at right angles with the slide 13, leverage is the greatest, and corresponds to the stamping action of the driver. Thus, for a constant actuating force, the maximum force applied to the driver occurs during stamping. \\n     An actuating mechanism 12&#39; similar to mechanism 12 of FIG. 1 is illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12. FIG. 11 depicts the retracted position of the slide 13 and FIG. 12 its advanced position. Spring 54 urges the trigger 51 out of the handle 53 and at the same time brings the sliding part 39, and with it the slide 13, into the retracted position. In the embodiment of FIG. 1 the transverse slot 50 of the trigger 51 has an angular shape, while in the embodiment of FIGS. 11 and 12, the transverse slot 50 is straight. \\n     Certain changes and modifications of the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. It is the applicants&#39; intention to cover by their claims all those changes and modifications which could be made to the embodiments of the invention herein chosen for the purpose of disclosure without department from the spirit and scope of the invention.\",\n          \"FIELD OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the destruction of the inner lining of body organs, and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for the selective destruction of the endometrium. \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to destroy one or more layers of the inner lining of various body organs. Such destruction may be advantageous in the treatment or prevention of certain diseases or other physical conditions. In particular, dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) which can be a problem for many women, and particularly for postmenopausal women. Various methods and apparatus have been used to destroy layers of living tissue without damaging the underlying layers. Some of the apparatus include devices for heating the layer to be destroyed using, for example, radio frequency energy and microwave energy. Alternatively, other thermal techniques for destroying the inner lining of various body organs include chemical treatments, cryotherapy, laser therapy and electrosurgery. \\n     U.S. Pat. No. 5,277,201 describes a method and apparatus for endometrial ablation utilizing an electrically conductive balloon adapted to supply Monopolar RF energy to the endometrial layer when the balloon is expanded within the body organ. U.S. Pat. No. 5,277,201 further illustrates a balloon device for use in endometrial ablation wherein the balloon surface includes a plurality of selectively excitable RF electrodes along with a plurality of selectable temperature sensors adapted to measure the temperature of the endometrium during the ablation process. U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,948 describes thermal ablation of the mucosal layer of a gallbladder by resistive heating with an RF balloon electrode. Electric current is delivered via a conductive expansion liquid which fills the balloon. Balloon catheters supplied with a heated fluid have also been used for thermal ablation of hollow body organs as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,056. Application of microwave and high frequency RF energy to destroy tissue, using electrodes enclosed in expanded balloons have been described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,662,383 and 4,676,258. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     According to the present invention, an apparatus for heating tissue in the interior of a body organ, for example the uterus, comprises an expandable element adapted to fit within the body organ wherein the expandable element is covered with a web of optically conductive material arranged to conduct light to the interior surface of the body organ. In this embodiment, the expandable element may include a reflective surface which reflects light from the optically conductive material to the interior surface of the body organ. \\n     In one embodiment of the present invention, the web of optically conductive material may be, for example, a web of optical fibers connected to one or more light sources, for example high intensity lamps or lasers, which generate the light energy transmitted by the optically conductive material. In a further embodiment of the present invention, temperature detection devices, for example thermocouples, are attached to the expandable element to measure the temperature of the lining of the body organ as it is being heated by the light energy transmitted by the optically conductive material. \\n     The present invention further includes a method of selectively heating the lining of a body organ utilizing the apparatus of the present invention including the steps of inflating the expandable element to fit within the body organ, heating the interior surface of the body organ by passing light energy from the light source through the optically conductive material to the lining. In addition, a method according to the present invention may include the step of measuring the temperature of the lining and selectively turning the light sources on and off to control the temperature of the lining. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims.

In FIG. 1, Optical Energy in the form of light is supplied to ablation instrument 10 by electro-optical generator 11. As used herein, the term &#34;optical&#34; is intended to include that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum including radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths. Electro-optical generator 11 includes an optical energy source 12, one or more energy coupling devices 14, one or more optical filters 16, one or more variable attenuators 18 which may also comprise a variable neutral density filter, one or more fiber optic bundles 20, one or more thermocouple inputs 24 and control circuitry 22. Optical energy source 12 may be, for example, a laser, a halogen lamp, a conventional incandescent lamp or other optical energy source. Optical energy source 12 may be a single source which provides light which is white or spectrally pure at a specific wavelength. Alternatively, Optical energy source 12 may include a plurality of light sources having any combination of wavelengths and power levels. Optical energy source 12 is coupled to fiber optic bundle 20 by energy coupling lens 14, optical filter 16 and variable attenuator 18. \\n     Energy coupling lens 14 focuses optical energy from optical energy source 12 through optical filter 16 and variable attenuator 18 onto the proximal end of fiber optic bundle 20. The intensity and/or wavelength of optical energy source 12 may be controlled by, for example, signals from control circuit 22 transmitted through control line 72. Optical filter 16 may be a single frequency filter adapted to filter out all but one of the wavelengths generated by optical energy source 12. Alternatively, Optical filter 16 may be a plurality of selectable filters from which a filter effective at one or more wavelengths may be chosen to selectively filter optical energy generated by optical energy source 12. Optical filter 16 may also be a spectral filter adapted to pass energy within a band of wavelengths. Optical filter 16 may also be a filter wheel which contains a number of band pass filters. The wavelength of light filtered by optical filter 16 may be controlled by, for example, signals from control circuit 22 transmitted through control line(s) 70. After passing through optical filter 16, energy from optical energy source 12 passes through variable attenuator 18. Variable attenuator 18 may also be referred to as a variable neutral density filter. Variable attenuator 18 is adapted to control the energy level of the light which is focused on to the proximal end of fiber optic bundle 20. The setting of variable attenuator 18 may be controlled by, for example, signals from control circuit 22 transmitted through control line(s) 74. The energy passed by variable attenuator 18 may be controlled by signals from control circuit 22 to ensure that the appropriate energy level is input to the proximal end of fiber optic bundle 20. \\n     Energy coupling lens 14 may include a plurality of energy coupling lenses, for example the three energy coupling lenses 14a, 14b and 14c illustrated in FIG. 1. Optical filter 16 may include a plurality of optical filters, for example, the three optical filters 16a, 16b and 16c illustrated in FIG. 1. Variable attenuator 18 may include a plurality of variable attenuators, for example, the three variable attenuators 18a, 18b and 18c illustrated in FIG. 1. In addition, fiber optic bundle 20 may include a plurality of fiber optic bundles, for example, the three fiber optic bundles illustrated in FIG. 1. The number of energy coupling lenses, optical filters, variable attenuators and fiber optic bundles will depend upon the design of the ablation system 15, however, the number of coupling lenses, optical filters, variable attenuators and fiber optic bundles will generally correspond to the number of regions the ablation instrument is designed to separately heat within the body cavity being treated. \\n     Electro-optic generator 22 includes temperature signal wires 24 which are adapted to relay signals representative of the temperature at selected points at the distal end of ablation instrument 10 to control circuit 22. The number of temperature signal wires 24 will depend upon the design of ablation system 15, however, the number of thermocouple inputs will generally correspond to a multiple of the number of regions the ablation instrument is designed to separately heat. In the embodiment of the ablation instrument illustrated in FIG. 1, the electro-optic generator includes three temperature signal wires 24a, 24b and 24c. In one embodiment of the present invention, temperature signal wires 24 comprise a pair of wires which are connected through ablation instrument 10 to a thermocouple at a distal end of the ablation instrument. \\n     Fiber optic bundles 20 and temperature signal wires 24 terminate at generator connector 19 which is adapted to mate with instrument connector 26. In FIG. 1, instrument connector 26 is shown in cutaway view to show fiber optic bundles 21a, 21b and 21c and to show thermocouple inputs 25a, 25b and 25c which are positioned within instrument connector 26 and flexible sleeve 27. Fiber optic bundles 20 exit electro-optic generator 11 at generator connector 19 where each fiber optic bundle 20a, 20b and 20c is butt-coupled to a corresponding fiber optic bundle 21a, 21b and 21c such that optical energy is transmitted from fiber optic bundles 20a, 20b and 20c to fiber optic bundles 21a, 21b and 21c, respectively. Temperature signal wires 24 also exit electro-optic generator 11 at generator connector 19 where temperature signal wires 24a, 24b and 24c are connected to temperature signal wires 25a, 25b and 25c, respectively. Fiber optic bundles 21 and temperature signal wires 25 pass through flexible sleeve 27 to instrument handle 28 and through instrument handle 28 to rigid sleeve 34. \\n     Instrument handle 28 includes connector 35, fluid source connector 29, sleeve retractor 32, sleeve retractor stop 33 and fluid line 36. Flexible sleeve 27, terminates at connector 35 while fiber optic bundles 21 and temperature signal wires 25 pass through connector support 27 and the central portion of instrument handle 28 to the central annulus of rigid sleeve 34. Fluid source connector 29, which is adapted to receive a fluid source such as, for example, syringe 30, is connected to fluid line 36. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, syringe 30 includes plunger 31 which is adapted to force fluid, for example air, through fluid line 36. Fluid line 36 extends from fluid source connector 29 to the annulus of rigid sleeve 34. \\n     In instrument handle 28 as illustrated in FIG. 1, sleeve retractor 32 is connected to sleeve collar 37 which is connected to rigid sleeve 34 such that rigid sleeve 34 may be retracted in the proximal direction by moving sleeve retractor 32 in the proximal direction. The travel of sleeve retractor 32 is limited by sleeve retractor stop 33, thus limiting the proximal travel of rigid sleeve 34. As rigid sleeve 34 is retracted, expandable sleeve tip 40 at the distal end of rigid sleeve 34 opens, releasing the balloon or other device positioned in the central annulus of rigid sleeve 34 at the distal end of sleeve 34. \\n     FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view of the ablation instrument illustrated in FIG. 1 along view line 2--2. In FIG. 2, fluid line 36 is surrounded by fiber optic bundles 21a, 21b and 21c and by temperature signal wires 25a, 25b and 25c. As illustrated in FIG. 2, fiber optic bundles 21a, 21b and 21c each include one or more fiber optic fibers 38 which are adapted to transmit optical energy. Temperature signal wires 25 are adapted to transmit signals representative of temperature. Fluid line 36 is adapted to transmit fluid such as, for example, air. \\n     FIG. 3 illustrates an optical ablation system according to the present invention including an ablation instrument and an alternative embodiment of an electro-optic generator. In the embodiment of electro-optic generator 11 illustrated in FIG. 3, optical energy source 12 of FIG. 1 is divided into a plurality of controllable optical energy sources 12a, 12b and 12c. In one embodiment of the present invention, the intensity of optical energy sources 12 is controllable and the energy from optical energy sources 12a, 12b and 12c is controlled by energy control signals from control circuit 22 which are transmitted through, for example, control lines 72. Each of energy sources 12a, 12b and 12c pass optical energy through energy coupling lenses 14a, 14b and 14c respectively. Energy coupling lenses 14a, 14b and 14c focus optical energy on fiber optic bundles 20a, 20b and 20c through optical filters 16a, 16b and 16c respectively. In one embodiment of the present invention, optical filters 16 may include a plurality of selectable optical filters which may be selected by filter selection signals from control circuit 22 which are transmitted through, for example, control lines 70. The number of energy coupling lenses, optical filters and fiber optic bundles will depend upon the design of ablation system 15, however, the number of coupling lenses, optical filters and fiber optic bundles will generally correspond to the number of regions the ablation instrument is designed to separately heat within the body cavity being treated. In all other respects, the ablation system 15 illustrated in FIG. 3 is substantially identical to the ablation system 15 illustrated in FIG. 1. \\n     FIG. 4 is a cutaway view of a cross section of an expandable diffusing web 46 according to the present invention. In FIG. 3 expandable defusing web 46 includes reflective coating 42, balloon 44, optical fiber mesh 47 and an adhesive layer 50 for attaching the fiber optic mesh to the balloon. Reflective coating 42 may be, for example, a coating of silver or other reflective material which covers the outer surface of Balloon 44. Balloon 44 may be constructed of, for example, mylar or other expandable balloon material. Optical fiber mesh 47 may include optical fibers 48, reflective fiber terminator 52 and fill threads 49. Fill threads 49 may be solid as illustrated in FIG. 4. Alternatively, fill threads 49 may be made of an optically conductive material. Optical fiber mesh 47 may be, for example, a light emitting woven light emitting panel which is manufactured by Ploy-Optic or by Lumitex. Reflective fiber terminator 52 is located at the end of optical fiber 48 to reflect any optical energy which reaches the end of optical fiber 48 without being diffused. \\n     FIG. 5 is a cutaway side view of the distal end of ablation instrument 10 according to the present invention prior to deployment of expandable diffusing web 46. In FIG. 5, the distal end of rigid sleeve 34, including expandable diffusing web 46 is disposed within uterus 56. Expandable diffusing web 46 is folded to fit within rigid sleeve 34. The interior of uterus 56 is covered by an endometrial layer 58. As rigid sleeve 34 is withdrawn, by, for example moving sleeve retractor 32, expandable diffusing web 46 forces expandable sleeve tip 40 open, exposing expandable diffusing web 46. Fluid line 36 is connected to the proximal end of expandable diffusing web 46 such that a fluid, such as air, supplied at fluid source connector 29 fills the interior of expandable diffusing web 46, forcing expandable diffusing web 46 to expand. \\n     FIG. 6 is a cutaway side view if the distal end of ablation instrument 10 according to the present invention after deployment of expandable diffusing web 46. In FIG. 6, rigid sleeve 34 has been retracted, exposing expandable diffusing web 46. Expandable diffusing web 46, which includes balloon 44 and optical fiber mesh 47 is expanded to fit against endometrial lining 58 of uterus 56 by filling balloon interior 60 with a fluid such as air. Fluid line 46 connects balloon interior 60 to fluid source connector 29. \\n     FIG. 7 is a side view of a balloon 44 for use in the present invention. It will be recognized that balloon 44 may be shaped to fit within any body cavity, however, in the embodiment of the invention described herein, expandable diffusing web 46 is designed to be used within the uterus to destroy the endometrial lining. Thus, balloon 44 illustrated in FIG. 7 is shaped to fit within the uterus and to hold the optical fiber mesh firmly against at least a substantial portion of the endometrial lining. Nor is it necessary that the invention be limited to the use of a balloon as an expandable element since any means of expanding expandable diffusing web 46 to position optical fiber mesh near or adjacent the interior lining (e.g. the endometrium) of the body cavity to be treated is within the scope of the present invention. In FIG. 7, balloon 44 has been expand ed by filling interior 60 with an appropriate fluid, such as air, and the expanded balloon 44 takes on the shape of the interior of a uterus. \\n     FIG. 8 is a side view of the distal end of ablation instrument 10 according to the present invention illustrating a portion of expandable diffusing web 46 which includes a first optical fiber mesh 47a. The embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 8 further includes a first thermocouple 62a. In FIG. 8, optical fiber mesh 47a is disposed on the distal end of balloon 44. In FIG. 8, optical fiber mesh 47a includes optical fibers 48a which are interwoven with fill threads 49a. At their proximal end, optical fibers 48a of optical fiber mesh 47a are connected to the distal end of one of fiber optic bundles 21 which extend through rigid sleeve 34, alternatively, optical fibers 48a of optical fiber mesh 47a may be a continuation of one of the optic fiber bundles 21. For example, the proximal ends of fiber optics 48a may be gathered together to form an optical fiber bundle 51a which is connected to, for example, the distal end of fiber optic bundle 21a using, for example a butt-connector such as the one used to connect fiber optic bundle 20a with fiber optic bundle 21a, alternatively, fiber bundle 51a may be a continuation of the distal end of fiber optic bundle 21a. Fiber optic bundle 21a is joined to or disperses to form optical fibers 48a such that optical energy is passed from fiber optic bundle 21a to optical fibers 48a, thus optical energy generated at optical energy source 12 may be transmitted through fiber optic bundle 20a to fiber optic bundle 21a and through fiber optic bundle 21a to optical fibers 48a of optical fiber mesh 47a. Thermocouple 62a is positioned to detect the temperature of tissue adjacent optical fiber mesh 47a. Temperature signal wires 25a, being connected to thermocouple 62a, relay a signal representative of the temperature at thermocouple 62a to temperature signal wires 24a which, in turn relay the signal to control circuit 22. Optical fiber mesh 47a, being positioned on balloon 44, is held in place against the tissue to be treated by the expansion of balloon 44 as a result of the fluid supplied through fluid line 36. \\n     FIG. 9 is a side view of the distal end of ablation instrument 10 according to the present invention illustrating a portion of expandable diffusing web 46 which includes a first optical fiber mesh 47a and a second optical fiber mesh 47b. The embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 9 further includes a first thermocouple 62a and a second thermocouple 62b. In FIG. 9, a second optical fiber mesh 47b has been wrapped around the distal end of the balloon illustrated in FIG. 8 to increase the surface area of balloon 44 covered by optical fiber mesh 47. Thus, the previous description of the instrument with respect to FIG. 8 is applicable with respect to like elements of FIG. 9. In addition to the elements described with respect to FIG. 8, FIG. 9 illustrates optical fiber mesh 47b which includes optical fibers 48b which are interwoven with fill threads 49b. At their proximal end, optical fibers 48b of optical fiber mesh 47b are connected to the distal end of one of fiber optic bundles 21 which extend through rigid sleeve 34. For example, the proximal ends of fiber optics 48b may be gathered together to form an optical fiber bundle 51b which is connected to, for example, the distal end of fiber optic bundle 21b using, for example, a butt-connector such as the one used to connect fiber optic bundle 20b with fiber optic bundle 21b, alternatively, fiber bundle 51b may be a continuation of the distal end of fiber optic bundle 21b. Fiber optic bundle 21b is joined to optical fibers 48b such that optical energy is passed from fiber optic bundle 21b to optical fibers 48b, thus optical energy generated at optical energy source 12 may be transmitted through fiber optic bundle 20b to fiber optic bundle 21b and through fiber optic bundle 21b to optical fibers 48b of optical fiber mesh 47b. Thermocouple 62b is positioned on balloon 44 to detect the temperature of tissue adjacent optical fiber mesh 47b. Temperature signal wires 25b, being connected to thermocouple 62b, relay a signal representative of the temperature at thermocouple 62b to temperature signal wires 24b which, in turn, relay the signal to control circuit 22. Optical fiber mesh 47b, being positioned on balloon 44, is held in place against the tissue to be treated by the expansion of balloon 44 as a result of the fluid supplied through fluid line 36. \\n     FIG. 10 is a side view of the distal end of ablation instrument 10 according to the present invention illustrating a portion of expandable diffusing web 46 which includes a first and optical fiber mesh 47a, a second optical fiber mesh 47b and a third optical fiber mesh 47c. The embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 10 further includes a first thermocouple 62a, a second thermocouple 62b and a third thermocouple 62c. In FIG. 10, a third optical fiber mesh 47c has been wrapped around the distal end of the balloon illustrated in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 to increase the surface area of balloon 44 covered by optical fiber mesh 47. Thus, the previous description of the instrument with respect to FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 is applicable with respect to like elements of FIG. 10. In addition to the elements described with respect to FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, FIG. 10 illustrates an optical fiber mesh 47c which includes optical fibers 48c which are interwoven with fill threads 49c. At their proximal end, optical fibers 48c of optical fiber mesh 47c are connected to the distal end of one of fiber optic bundles 21 which extend through rigid sleeve 34. For example, the proximal ends of fiber optics 48c may be gathered together to form an optical fiber bundle 51c which is connected to, for example, the distal end of fiber optic bundle 21c using, for example, a butt-connector such as the one used to connect fiber optic bundle 20c with fiber optic bundle 21c, alternatively fiber bundle 51c may be a continuation of the distal end of fiber optic bundle 21c. Fiber optic bundle 21c is joined to optical fibers 48c such that optical energy is passed from fiber optic bundle 21c to optical fibers 48c, thus optical energy generated at optical energy source 12 may be transmitted through fiber optic bundle 20c to fiber optic bundle 21c and through fiber optic bundle 21c to optical fibers 48c of optical fiber mesh 47c. Thermocouple 62c is positioned on balloon 44 to detect the temperature of tissue adjacent optical fiber mesh 47c. Temperature signal wires 25c, being connected to thermocouple 62c, relay a signal representative of the temperature at thermocouple 62c to temperature signal wires 24c which, in turn, relay the signal to control circuit 22. Optical fiber mesh 47c, being positioned on balloon 44, is held in place against the tissue to be treated by the expansion of balloon 44 as a result of the fluid supplied through fluid line 36. \\n     The embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 is adapted to controllably heat three separate regions within the uterus of a human patient to selectively destroy the endometrial layer within those regions. The energy and depth of penetration of the optical energy may be controlled by controlling the energy level and wavelength of the energy transmitted to the proximal end of each fiber optic bundle 20a, 20b and 20c. Longer wavelengths penetrate deeper into tissue. Shorter wavelengths, for example, blues and greens, may be used to achieve surface heating. Thus, depending on the effect that is desired, different wavelength of optical energy may be selected. Optical energy is transmitted through optical bundles 20 to optical bundles 21 and optical bundles 51. Optical energy which passes through optical bundles 51 is diffused by optical fiber mesh 47 of expandable diffusing web 46. Reflective coating 42 acts to reflect optical energy away from balloon 44 and into tissue surrounding expandable diffusing web 46. The depth of penetration of the optical energy into surrounding tissue will be a function of a number of factors, including the wavelength of the optical energy radiated by expandable diffusion web 46 and the distance from the expandable diffusion web 46 to the tissue to be treated. The rate at which the tissue is heated will also depend upon a number of factors, including the output energy generated by optical energy source 12, the losses in electro-optic generator 11 and ablation instrument 10, the distance from the expandable diffusion web 46 to the tissue to be treated and the wavelength of the optical energy. However, by monitoring the tissue as it is treated using, for example, thermocouples 62, the surgeon may control the temperature of the tissue being treated with relative accuracy. \\n     In use a surgeon will introduce the distal end of ablation instrument 10 into the body cavity of a patient such that expandable sleeve tip 40 is positioned at a predetermined depth within the body cavity. For the purposes of this discussion, the body cavity to be treated will be the uterus of a female human being. It will be recognized that, with slight modification, the present invention may be used to treat other body cavities. Once sleeve tip 40 is inserted into the uterus 56 as illustrated in FIG. 5, sleeve retractor 32 may be used to slide rigid sleeve 34 back away from expandable diffusing web 46. As rigid sleeve 34 is retracted, expandable diffusing web 46 forces expandable sleeve tip 40 open. Once sleeve retractor 32 reaches its proximal most travel point it is stopped by sleeve retractor stop 33 which prevents rigid sleeve 34 from retracting further. Once rigid sleeve 34 is retracted, expandable diffusing web 34 may be expanded to contact the interior of the uterus by, for example inflating balloon 44 by injecting an appropriate fluid, such as, for example air into balloon interior 60. Fluid is introduced into balloon 44 through fluid line 36 which is connected to fluid source connector 29 which, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, is connected to a syringe and plunger which may be used to inflate or deflate balloon 44. Expandable diffusing web 46, being shaped to fit the body cavity, e.g. the uterus, being treated, is designed to force optical fiber mesh 47 against a substantial portion of the interior surface of the body cavity. Thus, when expandable diffusing web 46 is fully expanded, optical fiber mesh 47 is positioned directly adjacent or in direct contact with endometrium 58 of uterus 56. \\n     Once expandable diffusing web 46 is positioned within uterus 56, optical energy may be supplied to optical fiber mesh 47 by turning on optical energy source 12. Once optical energy source 12 is turned on, the light radiated by optical energy source 12 is focused on the proximal end of optical fiber bundle 20 by energy coupling lens 14. As optical energy passes through optical filter 16, it is filtered to remove unwanted wavelengths. As optical energy passes through variable attenuator 18 the energy level is attenuated. Therefore, the optical energy focused upon fiber optic bundle 20 is filtered and attenuated such that it is optical energy of a selected wavelength and energy level. Optical energy focused upon the proximal end of fiber optic bundle 20 is transmitted through fiber optic bundle 20 to fiber optic bundle 21 and from fiber optic bundle 21 to expandable diffusing web 46 where it is radiated into the endometrial layer from optical fiber mesh 47. Where different optical energy levels or wavelengths are to be transmitted to different regions of the endometrium, a plurality of energy coupling lenses 14a-14c, optical filters 16a-16c and variable attenuators 18a-18c may be used to focus filtered optical energy onto a plurality of fiber optic bundles 20a-20c as illustrated in FIG. 1. Alternatively, where different optical energy levels or wavelengths are to be transmitted to different regions of the endometrium, a plurality of optical energy sources 12a-12c, energy coupling lenses 14a-14c and optical filters 16a-16c may be used to focus filtered optical energy onto a plurality of fiber optic bundles 20a-20c as illustrated in FIG. 2. The optical energy focused on optical bundles 20a-20c may then be transmitted through optical fiber bundles 21a-21c to each optical fiber mesh 47a-47c. \\n     Once the optical energy reaches expandable diffusing web 46, it is radiated by optical fibers 48 which are woven with fill threads 49 to form optical fiber mesh 47. Radiation from optical fibers 48 which is not directed into the tissue adjacent optical fiber mesh 47 is reflected by reflective coating 42 as illustrated in FIG. 4. Thus, both the energy radiated toward the tissue and the reflected energy is absorbed by the tissue adjacent to fiber optic mesh 47. Further, since the energy is transmitted optically, it is not necessary for the tissue to be directly adjacent fiber optic mesh 47 as the radiated energy will be absorbed by any tissue illuminated by the energy from the mesh. This arrangement provides for uniform escape or emission of energy focused on the fiber optic bundles 20 in fiber optic generator 11. Further, in an arrangement according to the present invention, energy is evenly radiated from the outside of the expandable diffusing web, and is, therefore absorbed by the endometrial lining of the uterus causing temperature of the tissue to rise. \\n     The control sequence for control circuit 22 of the electro-optic generator illustrated in FIG. 1 is illustrated in FIG. 11. Once expandable diffusing web 46 has been positioned and inflated as described previously, optical energy may be supplied to expandable web 46 to heat endometrial lining 58. The first step in supplying optical energy to endometrial lining 58 is to select an appropriate wavelength. In particular, red and near infrared wavelengths would be selected for heating deep (e.g. 0-10 millimeters) into uterine tissue. Ultraviolet, blue or green wavelengths would be used for heating uterine tissue to a depth of, for example, (0-3 millimeters). Once the appropriate optical energy wavelength has been selected by, for example, adjustment of optical filter 16 or by appropriate selection of optical energy source 12, optical energy may be supplied to expandable web 46. The energy level or intensity of the optical energy supplied to expandable web 46 may be controlled by controlling the attenuation of variable attenuators 18 or by controlling the intensity of optical energy source 12. Temperature feedback from thermocouple 62 may be used to adjust the energy level supplied to fiber optic bundles 20. Thus, the temperature of the body lining being treated is controlled by controlling the energy level supplied to expandable web 18 while the depth of penetration of the energy supplied to expandable web 46 is controlled by controlling the wavelength of the optical energy supplied to fiber optic bundles 20. \\n     The flow diagram of FIG. 11 illustrates the control sequence for the electro-optic generator illustrated in FIG. 1. The temperature of endometrial lining 58 is sensed by, for example, thermocouple 62 which provides a signal to control circuit 22 through temperature signal wires 24 and 25. As illustrated in FIG. 11, control circuit 22, in step 67, senses the temperature at thermocouple 62 and produces a signal 100 which is representative of the temperature measured at thermocouple 62. In step 68, signal 100 is compared to a predetermined set point temperature such as, for example, any temperature between 42\\u00b0 C. and 100\\u00b0 C. for a time sufficient to destroy the inner lining of the organ in question. If the temperature represented by signal 100 is lower than the set point temperature, control circuit 22 generates a signal 103. In step 71, signal 103 causes control circuit 22 to decrease the attenuation of the optical energy focused on optical fiber bundle 20, thus increasing the optical energy supplied to expandable web 46. Once the attenuation has been reduced, control circuit 22 generates a signal 105 which causes control circuit 22 to return to step 67 where the temperature is measured again and a new signal 100 is generated. Once the temperature represented by signal 100 reaches the set point temperature control circuit 22, in step 69, generates a signal 106 which is representative of the time the endometrium has been at the desired temperature. The time represented by signal 106 is compared, in step 72 to a predetermined set time and if the time represented by signal 106 is less than the predetermined set time, control circuit 22 generates signal 107 which returns control circuit 22 to step 67. If during the control cycle, the signal 100 rises above the set point temperature, then signal 102 is generated, causing control circuit 22 to increase attenuation at variable attenuators 18, thus decreasing the optical energy delivered to expandable diffusing web 46. Once the actual time at the desired temperature, represented by signal 106, reaches the predetermined set time in step 72, signal 108 is generated indicating, in step 73, that the procedure is complete and generating signal 109 which turns off optical energy source 12 in step 74. \\n     The flow diagram of FIG. 12 illustrates the control sequence for the electro-optic generator illustrated in FIG. 2. The temperature of endometrial lining 58 is sensed by, for example, thermocouple 62 which provides a signal to control circuit 22 through temperature signal wires 24 and 25. As illustrated in FIG. 12, control circuit 22, in step 80, senses the temperature at thermocouple 62 and produces a signal 200 which is representative of the temperature measured at thermocouple 62. In step 81, signal 200 is compared to a predetermined set point temperature. If the temperature represented by signal 200 is lower than the set point temperature, control circuit 22 generates a signal 203. In step 84, signal 203 causes control circuit 22 to increase the optical energy from optical energy source 12 which increases the intensity of the optical energy focused on optical fiber bundle 20, thus increasing the optical energy supplied to expandable web 46. Once optical energy has been increased, control circuit 22 generates a signal 205 which causes control circuit 22 to return to step 80 where the temperature is measured again and a new signal 200 is generated. Once the temperature represented by signal 200 reaches the set point, temperature control circuit 22, in step 82, generates a signal 206 which is representative of the time the endometrium has been at the desired temperature. The time represented by signal 206 is compared, in step 85 to a predetermined set time and, if the time represented by signal 206 is less than the predetermined set time, control circuit 22 generates signal 207 which returns control circuit 22 to step 80. If during the control cycle, the signal 200 rises above the set point temperature, then signal 202 is generated, causing control circuit 22 to decrease the optical energy from optical energy source 12, which decreases the intensity of the optical energy focused on optical fiber 20, decreasing the energy delivered to expandable diffusing web 46. Once the actual time at the desired temperature, represented by signal 206, reaches the predetermined set time in step 85, signal 208 is generated indicating, in step 86, that the procedure is complete and generating signal 209 which turns off optical energy source 12 in step 87. \\n     In operation, ablation instrument 10 would be connected to electro-optic generator 11 and the distal end of instrument 10 would be inserted into the appropriate body organ, for example, into the uterus 56. Rigid sleeve 34 would then be retracted using sleeve retractor 32, thereby exposing expandable diffusing web 46 which includes balloon 44. Balloon 44 is inflated using, for example, balloon inflator syringe 30 which includes plunger 30. Once balloon 44 is inflated forcing expandable diffusing web 46 to conform to the interior of uterus 56, electro-optic generator 11 is activated, thus delivering optical energy to optical fibers 48 of optical fiber mesh 47 on expandable diffusing web 46. Control circuit 22 is then used to monitor the heating of endometrial layer 58 of uterus 56 through thermocouple(s) 62. Control circuit 22 acts to bring endometrial layer 58 up to a desired temperature, hold endometrial layer 58 at that temperature for a predetermined length of time and then turn off optical energy to the endometrial layer. Expandable diffusing web 46 may then be collapsed by deflating balloon 44 using, for example syringe 30. Once expandable diffusing web 46 is deflated, it may be retracted from uterus 56. \\n     Use of an ablation instrument according to the present invention may be advantageous, when compared to electrosurgical or other apparatus for use in endometrial ablation, for example: Light energy may be less likely to interfere with the operation of the thermocouples; a light diffusing fiber-optic web may be more adaptable to expansion than RF electrodes; contact with the uterine wall is not required as it may be in an RF device; it is possible to control the depth of heating by controlling the wavelength of the optical energy applied to the endometrial lining. \\n     According to one embodiment of the present invention, light energy from optical energy source 12, which may be, for example, common projection lamps, may be used to uniformly heat the endometrium 58\\u00b0 to 70\\u00b0 C. and thereby ablate the endometrium. The array of fiber-optic mesh or webs 47 are connected individually to an array of high intensity lamps 12 via fiber-optic cables 20 and 21. Fiber optic mesh 47 may Heating of the endometrium 58 is achieved through absorption of the optical radiation transmitted through fiber optic cables 20 and 21. The temperature of each fiber optic web, for example fiber optic webs 47a-47c, is monitored by a thermocouple, for example 62a-62c, which, through a feedback loop including temperature signal wires 24 and 25 which are connected to control circuitry 22, controls the intensity of its associated lamp 12. In this embodiment, fiber-optic mesh 47 and thermocouples 62 cover the outside of an inflatable silvered mylar pouch or balloon 44. Balloon 44 is inserted into the uterus and then inflated. Inflation brings fiber-optic webs 47 and thermocouples 62 into contact with the endometrium or endometrial layer 58. Lamps 12 are then turned on and the temperature of the endometrium is monitored intensity of the optical energy supplied to fiber optic webs 47 is controlled by monitoring feedback from thermocouples 62 until therapy is complete. The silvered surface of mylar balloon 44 directs all the optical radiation into the endometrium for heating. \\n     While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only.

No. 473,260, filed May 24, 1974, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,936,253. \\n    \\n    \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     This invention relates to an improved method and apparatus of production of synthetic multifilamentary yarns having uniform quality from high molecular weight linear polymers, in particular polyesters, according to an improved melt spinning process. \\n     An important area of use of such synthetic multifilamentary yarns is the production of tire cord. A number of high polymers are well suited for this utility, especially polyesters and polyamides; however, in the following description reference will be made particularly to filaments of polyethylene terephthalate. \\n     Since tire cord and the structures formed from it are among the essential construction elements for the safety and useful life of a tire, high quality requirements are naturally placed on such endless filaments. In view of the alternating stretching and compression stresses which tires experience in operation, a necessary precondition for the use of synthetic multifilamentary yarns for tire cord is an adequate fatigue resistance of the filaments. For optimum results, it is critical that the individual filaments be substantially uniform. Accordingly, it is common practice to determine the coefficient of variation of the evenness of the yarn (U %) using an Uster evenness tester as manufactured by the Zellweger Company of Uster, Switzerland, and described in &#34;Handbook of Textile Testing and Quality Control&#34; by E. Groover and D. S. Hamby. \\n     Polyethylene terephthalate has come into strong prominence in the last few years for use in tire cord production. Polyethylene terephthalate unfortunately undergoes a considerable thermal decomposition between the conclusion of the production of the spinning raw material (raw polymer melt) and its subsequent shaping into threads. This thermal decomposition can be reduced if the molten spinning raw material is maintained for as short a time and at as low a temperature as possible. However, the residence time of the spinning melt in the spinning apparatus is prescribed by the dimensions of the apparatus, and the lower limit of the spinning temperature is determined by the highly undesirable condition of melt fracture. Where melt fracture occurs, the spun, unstretched filaments do not have a smooth or even surface, and exhibit fluctuations in diameter which are unacceptable for use in tire cord. \\n     It is evident from this that the spinning requirements are diametrically opposed. On the one hand, low melt temperature is required for low decomposition, and on the other hand, high spinning temperature is required for trouble-free spinning. It has been suggested that this problem may be overcome by supplying the polymer melt for melt spinning at a temperature below the spinning temperature and heating the melt prior to filament formation. Normally, the required increase in the temperature of the melt is accomplished by use of a spinning assembly that includes a spinning filter disposed upstream of the spinneret plate, the pressure drop across said spinning filter being at least about 150 atmospheres. \\n     Unfortunately, polyester yarn made in accordance with known processes is not completely satisfactory. In particular, fused filaments and excessive variation in the evenness of filaments (U %) has been noted when the polymer melt is extruded through the spinneret at a rate of about 50 pounds per hour or greater. Problems in fiber uniformity have been particularly troublesome in so-called double-end melt spinning of synthetic fibers, i.e., using one spin pot to feed both sides of a &#34;split&#34; spinneret. Accordingly, research has been continued in an effort to solve these deficiencies. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates to an improved process and apparatus for preparing synthetic multifilamentary yarns having uniform quality. The process may be summarized as follows: \\n     In a process for the production of a synthetic multifilamentary yarn from a high-molecular weight thermoplastic polymer, selected from the group consisting of linear polyester and polyamide polymers, by melt-spinning, including the steps of supplying a melt of said polymer at a temperature below the spinning temperature, and heating the melt to spinning temperature prior to filament formation, the improvement which comprises: \\n     a. extruding the molten synthetic polymer at a rate of at least 50 pounds per hour downwardly through a spinneret having a plurality of extrusion orifices. \\n     b. advancing the extruded filaments downwardly through a substantially stationary column of air having a temperature of 100\\u00b0 to 330\\u00b0 C. immediately below the spinneret, the average distance between adjacent filaments immediately below the spinneret being at least 0.24 inch, preferably 0.28 to 0.4 inch; and \\n     c. subsequently advancing the filaments downwardly through a quenching zone wherein they are in contact with cooling air introduced into the path of the filaments, said air contacting said filaments transverse, countercurrent and cocurrent in progressive order of their movement through said quenching zone, said air contacting the filaments at a volumetric rate of 100 to 800 cubic feet of air per pound of filaments entering the quenching zone. \\n     The apparatus for carrying out the process of the present invention comprises a spinning unit comprising a spinning pump, a spinneret, and a spinning filter disposed between said pump and said spinneret, for extruding a plurality of filaments downwardly into a heated sleeve, the wall of said heated sleeve being imperforate and secured to the spinneret in an air-tight manner, said heated sleeve leading downwardly to a quenching chamber having an inlet and an outlet for allowing cooling air to pass through the chamber and means for regulating the stream of cooling air passing through said chamber whereby both the volumetric rate of the air stream and its general direction as it contacts the descending plurality of filaments may be regulated. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     FIG. 1 is a schematic front view of the preferred apparatus used for the process of this invention. \\n     FIG. 2 is a schematic side view of the preferred apparatus used for the process of this invention. \\n     FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the quenching chimney labeled 6 in FIGS. 1 and 2, parts having been broken away to reveal details of construction. \\n     FIG. 4 is a schematic of a two end embodiment of the draw panel labeled 9 in FIGS. 1 and 2. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT \\n     It has now been found that synthetic multifilament yarn, e.g., polyethylene terephthalate multifilament yarn, including such yarn of high denier per filament, e.g., 20 to 50 denier per filament (undrawn) can be melt spun continuously at high production rates such as 50 to 90 pounds per hour, and this yarn can be continuously drawn without an intermediate step of winding up, at draw ratios of at least 4:1. These results are achieved in accordance with this invention, by employing a controlled quenching of the melt spun filaments under critical conditions whereby the coefficient of variation of the evenness of the yarn (U %) is not above 10. More specifically, in accordance with the present process, a relatively large number of heavy filaments are extruded downwardly into a substantially stationary column of air having a temperature of 100\\u00b0 to 330\\u00b0 C. and a height of from 0.5 to 2 feet, preferably 1 to 1.5 feet, immediately below the spinneret, the distance between adjacent filaments immediately below the spinneret being preferably 0.28 to 0.4 inch, and subsequently advancing the filaments through a quenching zone wherein they are contacted with cooling air entering the zone at a volumetric flow rate of 100 to 800, preferably 200 to 700 cubic feet of air (measured at standard temperature and pressure) per pound of entering filaments, the air being at inlet temperature preferably not above 35\\u00b0 C. Especially effective is a split flow of air in the cooling zone, said air contacting the filaments transverse, countercurrent, and cocurrent in progressive order of their movement through the quenching zone, whereby the temperature of said filaments is reduced to not over 55\\u00b0 C. \\n     One preferred embodiment of this invention is directed to an improved melt spinning process and apparatus involving double-end spin-draw and take-up for multifilament synthetic polymer fibers. The accompanying drawings illustrate the preferred apparatus. \\n     Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, like numbers indicate like apparatus. Molten polymer is fed by extruder 1 to spinning pump 2 which feeds spinning block 3 containing a conventional spinning pot, not shown, including a spinneret and a spinning filter disposed between said spinning pump and said spinneret. The spinning pot spinneret is divided into two parts by means of an undrilled stripe wide enough to form a visible stripe between the two multifilament continuous ends 4 and 5. Said multifilament continuous ends 4 and 5 are extruded from the spinneret at a rate of at least 50 pounds per hour, preferably 50-90 pounds per hour, and are passed downwardly through a heated sleeve 15 immediately below the lower part of the spinneret. The heated sleeve has a baffle 16 forming an inwardly extending flange at the end of the heated sleeve remote from the spinneret to minimize the flow of cooling air into the heated sleeve. The two multifilament continuous ends are cooled in quenching chimney 6 (described hereinafter and shown in FIG. 3), pass over finish roll 7 through two guides 8 to draw panel 9 (described hereinafter and shown in FIG. 4). Then the two ends, 4 and 5 pass to winder 10 through traverse guide, not shown, mounted on a cam in cam housing 11 which traverses the yarn across drive roll 12 which drives chucks 13 and 14 by surface driving a package of yarn. Each end is separately wound up on chucks 13 and 14. \\n     As previously mentioned, FIG. 3 shows a preferred embodiment of quenching chimney 6 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The multifilament continuous ends 4 and 5 pass downwardly from the heated sleeve 15 through heated sleeve baffle 16 directly into the top of quenching chimney 6. Quenching chimney 6 is an elongated chimney at least 60 inches in height, preferably 60 to 80 inches in height, which is rectangular in cross-section and provided with imperforate top, rear, and side walls. The front of the chimney is partially covered by an imperforate door 31 which terminates short of the top of the wall and presents an open passage for air discharging from the chimney 6. At the lower rear side thereof, the quenching chimney 6 communicates with a duct 32 through which quenching air at substantially room temperature is introduced. The interior of quenching chimney 6 is partitioned by a perforated distribution plate 34 and a distribution screen 35, which forms the boundary between a plenum chamber 36, to which air is introduced from inlet duct 32, and a quenching chamber 37 through which the multifilament continuous ends 4 and 5 pass. In the top portion of quenching chamber 37 above door 31, provision is made for a plurality, preferably 2 to 5, parallel baffles 38 of shaped profile which form sections 39 intended to provide guided travel of the air stream transverse to the movement of the multifilament continuous ends 4 and 5 through said top portion of quenching chamber 37. The multifilament continuous ends 4 and 5 pass through the length of quenching chamber 37 and leave the quenching chamber, preferably through a shaped baffle 33 at the bottom of said chamber. The quenching air enters the plenum chamber 36 through duct 32, passes through distribution plate 34 and distribution screen 35 to the quenching chamber 37. The direction of air flow in quenching chamber 37 is indicated by arrows in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. As shown by these arrows, the quenching air preferably contacts the filaments, transverse, countercurrent, and cocurrent in progressive order of their movement through the quenching chamber 37. Preferably, 2 to 5 parallel baffles 38 are used; however the baffle requirement depends somewhat on the denier produced and the throughput as shown in the specific examples. \\n     FIG. 4 shows the preferred embodiment for a two end embodiment for the draw panel 9 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Yarn passes from the quenching chimney 6 to a pretension roll 21 with its accompanying separator roll 21a, then onto first feed roll pair Godet rolls 22 and 23, then through the draw point localizer 29 which can be a conventional heated pin or a steam jet, then to a draw roll pair of Godet rolls 24 and 25, then to a relaxation pair of Godet rolls 26 and 27 and optionally through an entangling apparatus such as a conventional steam or air operated interlacing jet, and on to winder 10 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. \\n     It is important that the above-described process and apparatus of the present invention permits a significant increase in production capacity of a polymer spinning operation. In some cases, it is practical to convert a single-end fiber plant to double-end plant with only simple changes in the original equipment, the yarn production being increased for example by a factor of 2. Also, the present invention substantially overcomes problems of poor yarn quality such as the formation of loose filament loops and broken filaments. Further, the present invention greatly improves the mechanical quality problems of double-end spinning caused by fused filaments and filament irregularity in undrawn filaments. \\n     In order to demonstrate the invention, the following examples are given. They are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims. In these examples, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The intrinsic viscosity of the polyester is given as a measure for the mean molecular weight, which is determined by standard procedures wherein the concentration of the measuring solution amounts to 0.5 g/100 ml., the solvent is a 60 percent phenol-40 percent tetrachloroethane mixture, and the measuring temperature is 25\\u00b0 C. In the examples, the diameter fluctuations along an unstretched bundle of filaments serve as a measure of uniformity. For high quality yarn, it is important that the filaments be substantially uniform. Accordingly, the coefficient of variation of the evenness (U %) is determined using an Uster evenness tester manufactured by the Zellweger Company of Uster, Switzerland and described in &#34;Handbook of Textile Testing and Quality Control&#34; by E. Groover and D. S. Hamby. \\n     EXAMPLE 1 \\n     A melt of polyethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.92 was supplied at a rate of 60 pounds per hour, at a temperature of about 291\\u00b0 C., to the temperature shown in FIGS. 1 to 4. The molten polymer was fed by extruder 1 to spinning pump 2 which fed spinning block 3 containing a conventional spinning pot comprising a spinning filter and a spinneret, the spinning filter being disposed between the spinning pump and the spinneret. The spinning filter consisted of a conventional sieve filter combination of 24 metal screen layers. The pressure drop through said spinning filter averaged 200 to 400 atmospheres. The spinning pot was enclosed in a controlled high temperature atmosphere so that loss of heat from the polymer was minimized. The melt enthalpy increase through the pump and sieve filter was sufficient to heat the melt at a point immediately above the spinneret to about 305\\u00b0-310\\u00b0 C., and the pressure at this point was about 50 atmospheres. The flow of polymer through the spinneret was maintained at a constant rate of 60 pounds per hour by spinning pump 2. \\n     The spinning pot spinneret was divided into two parts by means of an undrilled &#34;stripe&#34; wide enough to form a visible split between the multiple ends below the spinneret. The spinneret was preferably positioned with respect to the quenching chimney 6 so that the &#34;stripe&#34; was parallel to the side walls of said chimney and therefore to the flow of cooling air through the top portion of said chimney. The spinneret plate had 384 holes (192 holes on each side of the undrilled stripe), each of 0.018 inch diameter, spaced so that the distance between the filaments formed was 0.28 to 0.40 inch immediately below the spinneret. \\n     From said spinneret there was extruded two ends of multifilament, continuous filament yarn, and the two ends were passed downwardly into a substantially stationary column of air contained in a heated sleeve 15, about 15 inches in height, disposed surrounding and immediately beneath the spinneret. The air temperature in the heated sleeve was maintained at about 300\\u00b0 C. at the top of the sleeve, decreasing to about 115\\u00b0 C. at the bottom. The temperature of the metal in the heated sleeve was about 330\\u00b0 C. at the top and 220\\u00b0 C. at the bottom of the sleeve. The minimum distance between filaments at the bottom of the heated sleeve was about 0.24 inches. A heated sleeve baffle 16 was provided at the bottom of the heated sleeve forming an inwardly extending flange to minimize flow of cooling air into the heated sleeve. \\n     Yarn leaving the heated sleeve was passed directly into the top of quenching chimney 6, shown in detail in FIG. 3. The quenching chimney was an elongated chimney 70 inches in height, substantially rectangular in cross-section and provided with imperforate top, rear and side walls. The front of the chimney was partially covered by an imperforate door 31 which terminated about 17.5 inches short of the top wall and presented an open passage for air discharging from the chimney. The interior of the quenching chimney was partitioned by a perforated distribution plate 34 and distribution screen 35, which formed the boundary between plenum chamber 36, and quenching chamber 37. Quenching air at about 25\\u00b0 C. and 65% relative humidity was supplied to plenum chamber 36 from inlet duct 32, at about 200 cubic feet of air per pound of filaments entering the quenching chamber 37. \\n     The two ends of multifilament, continuous filament yarn were advanced downwardly through quenching chamber 37 wherein they were in contact with the cooling air introduced into the path of the filaments. Four horizontal parallel baffles 38 approximately 3 inches apart vertically and extending down about 12 inches from the top quenching chamber 37 were used to provide transverse contact of the cooling air with the filaments in the top portion of the quenching chamber. In the middle portion of the quenching chamber below the horizontal baffles 38, the cooling air was deflected upward by imperforate door 31 and flowed substantially countercurrent to the movement of the filaments, said air leaving the quenching chamber via the opening above imperforate door 31. Part of the cooling air flowed out of the bottom of the quenching chamber with the filaments, and the air flow in the bottom zone of the quenching chamber was substantially cocurrent to the movement of the filaments. This novel quenching system increased quenching efficiency significantly as evidenced by air temperature and air velocity profiles. The number of horizontal stack baffles 38 required to obtain improved undrawn yarn quality was preferably 2to 5 as shown in Example 2. The temperature of the cooled yarn at the bottom of quenching chamber 37 was about 50\\u00b0 C. In the present example, where polyester was supplied at 60 pounds per hour, 4 parallel horizontal baffles 38 gave high quality yarn; the coefficient of variation of the evenness of the undrawn yarn (U %) was not above 10 over an extended period of operation. \\n     The two ends of cooled, multifilament continuous filament yarn were advanced downwardly, preferably through a shaped baffle 33 at the bottom of quenching chamber 37. The ends were separated by guides 8 located below a lubricating finish applicator 7. Following lubrication, the ends passed through a guide separation to pretension roll 21 with its accompanying separator roll 21a, shown in FIG. 4. The yarn was then passed over cold feed roll pair Godet rolls 22 and 23, then through a draw point localizer which was a conventional steam jet, then to a draw roll pair of Godet rolls 24 and 25 operated at about 145\\u00b0 C. and traveling at a speed 5.0 to 6.6 times faster than the feed roll, then to a relaxation pair of Godet rolls 26 and 27, and optionally through an entangling apparatus such as a conventional air operated interlacing jet, and on to winder 10 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Typical yarn prepared at a draw ratio of 6 had the following properties: \\n     Denier; 1,000 \\n     Tenacity, g/d; 9.25 \\n     Elongation, %; 13.5 \\n     Shrinkage, %; 9.5 \\n     It will be understood that the above-described draw panel can be modified if desired. For example, the yarn may be drawn on a seven roll panel or on a four roll panel. However, regardless of panel set up, the draw panel process steps involve pretensioning to provide yarn stability on the rolls and on entry of the yarn into the draw point localizer steam jet, feed rolls to provide constant yarn supply to the draw zone, a draw point localizer to provide drawdown point in the draw zone, draw rolls to maintain constant draw ratio and relax rolls to provide for control of yarn physical properties. Optionally, a yarn compaction jet may be used before or after the relax rolls to provide yarn entanglement. \\n     EXAMPLE 2 \\n     A series of tests were carried out to produce yarn using the process and apparatus of Example 1 but modifying various factors to show the criticality of the process and apparatus elements required to product high quality yarn, particularly yarn wherein the coefficient of variation of the evenness of the undrawn yarn (U %) is not above 10. Most important effect noted was the interaction effect resulting when the cooling air introduced into the path of the filaments contacts the filaments transverse, countercurrent and cocurrent in progressive order of their movement through the quenching chamber. With use of the preferred apparatus, the air flow was easily controlled by adjusting the height and position of the imperforate door 31 and the number and position of the parallel baffles 38 at the top portion of quenching chamber 37. Particularly desirable results were obtained by a combination wherein the imperforate door 31 blocked 70-80%, preferably about 75% of the lower part of the front of the quenching chamber and 2 to 5 horizontal baffles 38 were used in the top portion of the quenching chamber. The following table indicates the criticality of various elements. In these tests, the standard deviation (\\u03c3) of the Uster value (U %) was about 1.0%, and a difference of 3% or more between values is significant at greater than the 99% level. \\n     \\n                       TABLE I______________________________________Quenching Chamber Trials(1,000 Denier Yarn at 60 Pounds/Hour Throughput)Number ofBaffles (HeatedSleeve Baffle   Door        Uster ValueUsed)           Blockage    (U %)______________________________________None            Lower 75%   251               Lower 75%   142               Lower 75%   93               Lower 75%   94               Lower 75%   85               Lower 75%   8None            Lower 75%   24None            Open        14None (with Heated           Lower 75%   31Sleeve Baffle Removed)______________________________________ \\n    \\n     These data show that improved yarn (low U%) resulted when the heated sleeve baffle was used, the lower 75% of the front of the quenching chamber was blocked, and 2 to 5 horizontal baffles 38 were used in the top portion of the quenching chamber. In additional tests, similar results were shown for 1,000 denier yarn at 53 pounds/hour throughput. For 1,000 denier and 1,300 denier yarn at 80 pounds/hour throughput, optimum Uster (U %) was obtained using 4 baffles located 3, 6, 12 and 18 inches from the top of the quenching chamber with a baffle 33 at the bottom of the quenching chamber. This same baffle arrangement was also applicable to 1,000 and 1,300 denier yarns at lower throughputs. \\n     EXAMPLE 3 \\n     The apparatus shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 supplied 60 pounds/hour e-polycaprolactam to a spinning pot enclosed in a controlled high temperature environment. The spinning pot spinneret was divided into two parts by means of an undrilled &#34;stripe&#34; wide enough to form a visible split between the multiple ends below the spinneret. The average distance between adjacent filaments immediately below the spinneret was 0.28 to 0.4 inch. The ends were advanced downwardly through a substantially stationary column of air maintained at 100\\u00b0 to 330\\u00b0 C. in heated sleeve 15. The ends were then advanced downwardly through quenching chimney 6 wherein they were contacted with cooling air introduced into the path of the filaments, said air at 25\\u00b0 C. contacting the filaments transverse, countercurrent and cocurrent in progressive order of their movement through the quenching chimney 6. The air contacted the filaments at a volumetric rate of about 200-300 cubic feet of air per pound of filaments entering the quenching chimney 6. The ends were separated by guides 8 located below a finish applicator 7. After lubrication, the ends passed through a guide separation and onto a heated feed roll and accompanying idler roll. Feed roll temperature was maintained at 80 \\u00b1 10\\u00b0 C. The yarn ends were then passed around a first stage draw roll and accompanying idler roll at a peripheral speed 2.5-4.0 greater than the feed roll. The draw roll temperature was kept below 50\\u00b0 C. (Optionally a heated draw pin at 65\\u00b0-85\\u00b0 C. is placed between the feed and first stage draw rolls). The yarn ends were then directed to a draw point localizer. The ends were then passed around a heated roll and accompanying idler roll at 125\\u00b0-210\\u00b0 C., which operated at a peripheral speed 1.4-2.3 times that of the first stage draw roll. The yarn was then taken up on a multi-end winder. \\n     Discussion \\n     In additional tests, we have shown that conventional crossflow quenching of polyester and polyamide yarn is satisfactory for relatively low filament counts of say less than 200 filaments and relatively low throughputs of less than 35 pounds per hour through the spinneret. However, for increased production capacity, e.g., 50 to 90 pounds per hour through the spinneret, and particularly for double-end production requiring a total of for example 380-400 filaments, standard quenching was found inadequate as indicated by fused filaments and poor filament uniformity. We have found that the quenching chamber baffles described in the present disclosure when used in combination with a heated sleeve baffle and a partially blocked quenching chamber door, gave the improved quenching efficiency required. Blocking the door of the quenching chamber below the baffled area forced a much greater percentage of cooling air to be carried through the yarn in the zone just below the heated sleeve removing more heat, causing the yarn to be blown in a steady arch, and permitting higher air rates while improving yarn quality. Major advantages gained by the present invention include improved filament uniformity, elimination of fused filaments, improved air velocity profiles and improved quench air temperature profiles. Smoke tests were utilized to show that as the filaments were advanced downwardly through the quenching zone, the cooling air contacted said filaments transverse, countercurrent, and cocurrent in progressive order of their movement through the quenching zone. \\n     The present invention is particularly useful for economical production of polyamide and polyester tire and industrial yarn. By &#34;polyamide&#34; is meant the polymers made by condensation of diamines with dibasic acids or by polymerization of lactams or amino acids, resulting in a synthetic resin characterized by the recurring group --CONH--. The preferred polyesters are the linear terephthalate polyesters, i.e., polyesters of a glycol containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and a dicarboxylic acid component containing at least about 75% terephthalic acid. The remainder, if any, of the dicarboxylic acid component may be any suitable dicarboxylic acid such as sebacic acid, adipic acid, isophthalic acid, sulfonyl-4,4&#39;-dibenzoic acid, or 2,8-di-benzofuran-dicarboxylic acid. The glycols may contain more than two carbon atoms in the chain, e.g., diethylene glycol, butylene glycol, decamethylene glycol, and bis-1,4-(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane. Examples of linear terephthalate polyesters which may be employed include poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(butylene terephthalate), poly (ethylene terephthalate/5-chloroisophthalate) (85/15), poly(ethylene terephthalate/5-[sodium sulfo]isophthalate) (97/3), poly(cyclohexane-1,4-dimethylene terephthalate), and poly(cyclohexane-1,4-dimethylene terephthalate/hexahydroterephthalate) (75/25).\",\n          \"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     Various fibrous materials, such as paper, paperboard, fiberboard and cellulose wet-lap, are made by forming a slurry or so-called stock of the fibrous material and other ingredients well dispersed in water and delivering the stock as a ribbon-like jet to a web former, such as the well-known Fourdrinier machine or a twin wire former. The mechanical properties and various other characteristics of the web produced by the web former are to a significant extent controlled by the characteristics of the stock delivered to the former from the headbox, and it is extremely important to the obtaining of high quality in the finished web that the fibers and other ingredients, such as fillers and additives, be thoroughly mixed in micro scale as well as macro scale. It is also important that the fibers be as free as possible of engagement with other fibers in the stock delivered from a headbox, i.e., that the fibers not be entangled in flocs. \\n     Although to a considerable extent mixing of the stock occurs prior to feeding the stock to the headbox, one important function of a headbox is to give the stock a thorough final mixing so that the fibers and other ingredients are dispersed uniformly throughout the jet delivered through the slice opening. Among other important functions of a headbox are: the delivery of a precisely uniform thickness jet across the entire width of the former to ensure that the basis weight of the web is uniform; to deliver the stock jet at a controlled velocity to ensure uniformity of web properties from point to point lengthwise of the web and, particularly in twin wire formers, to control the mechanical properties of the web; to deliver a clean, smooth jet free of disturbances and irregularities, notably, machine direction streaks, waves due to velocity variations, water-hammer phenomena or wake effects from structures inside the headbox, and sprays of free drops. \\n     Various headboxes that have been proposed or used over the past few decades have been equipped with elements intended to fulfill the mixing function of a headbox. Most of these elements are one or another form of obstruction interposed in the path of stock flow through the headbox to generate turbulence which, in turn, produces mixing. The obstructions have included baffles, perforated plates, rods, specially shaped vanes, perforated rolls and plates or sheets disposed parallel to the stock flow. Another approach has involved varying the cross section of the stock flow passages such as by providing projections extending from the walls of the headbox into the flow path. Vibrating plates and rods intended to induce mixing by mechanical vibration of the stock as it flows through the headbox have been tried. The various measures that have been proposed and used to enhance mixing of the stock in headboxes have, of course, been effective to various degrees, including some that have been quite successful. However, many of such measures have required trading off optimum results of one or more other functions of the headbox for improved mixing. For example, perforated plates are prone to clogging and to increasing the extent of floc formation due to the build up of flocs at the plates which break away periodically into the stock flow. Perforated plates and rods and vanes of various types also normally tend to produce wake effects that are reflected in streaks in the web. Some mixing devices have proven to be largely ineffective, for example, vibrating objects. Other mixing devices have been prone to mechanical failure from time to time, thus requiring shutdown of the machine for headbox repairs at very considerable costs in terms of lost production. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     There is provided, in accordance with the present invention, a headbox that produces a well-mixed stock, in both macro scale and micro scale, is of strong, reliable, trouble-free construction, produces a stock layer free of wake effects and other across the sheet disturbances and delivers a smooth, well formed, coherent jet. \\n     The headbox includes, as an important aspect of the invention, a fine-mixing stage that has exhibited the ability to form, for the first time, webs having a greater strength in the cross-machine direction than in the machine direction, i.e., an MD/CD tensile strength ratio of substantially less than 1.0. The structure of the headbox is such that it may be of smaller size and weight than comparable, previously known headboxes while still providing the required strength and rigidity. \\n     The headbox comprises a stock mixing section which includes a rectifier stage constructed to produce a multiplicity of closely-spaced, relatively small-diameter separate streams of stock flowing at substantially higher velocities than the velocities of stock flow in other parts of the mixing section. Preferably, the rectifier stage consists of a pair of transverse plates spaced apart from each other in the direction of stock flow and having equal numbers of holes and tubes connecting the holes in the respective plates, thus to constitute a tube bank. The tubes of the rectifier stage should be of lengths not less than about 5 times, and preferably at least 15 times, the hydraulic diameters in order substantially to eliminate any cross flow tendencies that may exist in the stock flow as it leaves the large-scale mixing stage. \\n     In addition to their function of separating the tubes, the transverse plates of the rectifier stage are structural elements of the headbox that impart strength and rigidity to it, particularly cross-machine rigidity that minimizes deflection of the walls of the stock delivery nozzle. Thus, the transverse plates reduce the need for externally located structural elements, and thus allow a reduction in the size of the headbox, as compared to presently known headboxes. When required, the rigidity of the headbox can be further increased by installing additional plates that extend between the tubes and are connected to the aforementioned pair of transverse plates. \\n     The rectifier stage can, of course, be constructed in other ways, e.g., from a solid piece of material in which the rectifier &#34;tubes&#34; are holes drilled in the piece of material. \\n     The mixing section further includes a fine-mixing stage that is located downstream from, and preferably immediately adjacent, the rectifier stage. The fine-mixing stage is constituted by a chamber of the stock mixing section of the headbox which is divided into a multiplicity of flow passages by closely-spaced planar lamellae oriented (1) substantially parallel to the medial axis in the flow direction of the fine-mixing chamber, and (2) oblique to an axial-transverse medial plane of the fine-mixing chamber, i.e., a plane defined by the axis in the flow direction of the fine-mixing chamber and by a medial line perpendicular to that axis and extending transversely of the fine-mixing chamber. The multiplicity of stock streams are delivered from the rectifier stage to the fine-mixing stage and produce in the passages between the closely-spaced lamellae relatively narrow eddies of low to medium intensity which produce medium to fine-scale mixing of the stock. The nature of the mixing action in the fine-mixing stage of the headbox is described in greater detail below. \\n     The average superficial velocity of stock flow through the fine-mixing stage is substantially less than the velocity of stock flow through the rectifier stage, and the flow at the end of the fine-mixing stage is relatively calm and essentially free of large-scale eddies. The stock flows from the fine-mixing stage into a delivery nozzle defined by opposed converging walls that terminate in a slice opening, and the stock is thus smoothly and relatively rapidly accelerated to the desired delivery velocity. The axes in the flow direction of the nozzle and the fine-mixing stage preferably intersect at an angle of the order of from 95\\u00b0 to 120\\u00b0. The relatively calm flow at the juncture between the nozzle and the fine-mixing stage permits the stock to turn without generating undesirable disturbances. To this end, the stock-receiving end of the stock delivery nozzle is designed such that the superficial velocity in the direction of flow towards the slice opening is essentially constant in the zone along the top of the fine-mixing (lamellae) stage. \\n     The lengths and hydraulic diameters of the passages in the rectifier stage and the fine-mixing stage are chosen with the objective of creating turbulence of moderate intensity in the form of small to medium scale eddies in the passages between the lamellae. Because those passages are relatively narrow, the eddy currents tend to be predominantly aligned in directions parallel to the lamellae. The lengths and hydraulic diameters of the passages in the rectifier and fine-mixing stages are also chosen with a view to inducing the eddies generated in the fine-mixing section to make, on the average, several revolutions before leaving the fine-mixing section and entering the delivery nozzle, thus sustaining the mixing action within the fine-mixing stage for a relatively substantial period of time. The overall cross section of the fine-mixing stage is established such as to provide a relatively low average velocity of stock flow (of the order of 2 to 5 feet per second) in the fine-mixing stage so that the flow conditions of the stock upon entering the delivery nozzle are smooth and the stock can turn into the nozzle without the generation of large-scale disturbances. \\n     There are a number of advantages resulting from turning the stock through a substantial angle from the downstream end of the fine-mixing stage to the nozzle. As described above, the moderately intense and relatively fine-scale turbulence in the fine-mixing stage is in the form of eddies that tend to be aligned parallel to the lamellae. As those eddies reach the end of the fine-mixing stage, they tend to be progressively peeled away into the nozzle such that the re-combination of individual flows of stock in the passages between the lamellae is by way of, with respect to any selected cross-machine location, a &#34;sampling&#34; of flows from several passages between lamellae. That sampling tends to produce a combined flow in the nozzle composed of layers, each of which comes from a different passage in the fine-mixing stage, but by making the turn, the peeling away of eddies from the passages in the fine-mixing stage takes place progressively and inherently provides a mixing effect on a scale of the order of the total width in the machine direction of the fine-mixing stage. The turning of the stock in entering the nozzle also tends to break up the eddies, enhance the fine-scale mixing of the stock, and prevent large scale eddies from forming. \\n     Extensive testing on a pilot headbox has revealed an unexpected characteristic, the ability to produce a web having a greater strength in the cross-machine direction than in the machine direction (i.e., MD/CD ratios substantially less than 1.0). Although the precise reasons for the tendency for fibers in the web to attain an alignment that is on the average preferential in the cross-machine direction is not completely understood at the present time, such preferential fiber alignment may well result from the tendency for the eddies in the fine-mixing stage to be aligned parallel to the lamellae and the persistence of such alignment in the delivered jet upon smooth rapid acceleration of the flow in the nozzle. It has been found that within the normal ranges of selected relative velocities of the jet and the forming surface (surfaces in twin wire machines with drainage through both wires), fiber orientation and MD/CD ratio can be controlled over a greater range than is possible with presently known headboxes. \\n     A headbox, according to the present invention, may, to considerable advantage, be constructed to form a multi-layer jet for the production in the former of a multi-ply web by providing transverse divider walls, as required, in the mixing and distribution section and in the delivery nozzle to maintain stocks delivered to the headbox from two or more sources separate until just prior to delivery through the slice opening. \\n     In a multi-ply configuration of the headbox, the orientation of the lamellae in the fine-mixing stages of the respective compartments formed by the divider wall or walls can be made substantially different, preferably by skewing the lamellae in one compartment to the opposite hand from the lamellae in the other compartment. The abovementioned tendency for the fibers in the web to reflect the orientations of the lamellae results in a multi-ply web having different fiber orientations in the different layers, thus producing &#34;a plywood effect&#34; in that the fiber orientations in the different layers are at angles to each other and the overall strength characteristics of the total web are greater than the combined strengths of the individual layers of the web. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     FIG. 1 is a perspective view in schematic form of an embodiment of a headbox, according to the present invention; \\n     FIG. 2 is a diagram depicting very schematically on a relatively large scale the flow conditions in the fine-mixing section of the headbox of FIG. 1; \\n     FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view on an enlarged scale of a portion of the fine-mixing section taken along a plane substantially perpendicular to the axis in the flow direction; \\n     FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view on a larger scale of a portion of the rectifier and fine-mixing stages of the headbox of FIG. 1; \\n     FIG. 5 is a pictorial view in schematic form of a multi-ply headbox; and \\n     FIG. 6 is a side view showing the details of a mounting for a divider wall in the nozzle of the multi-ply headbox of FIG. 5, the view being of the region enclosed in the circle labelled &#34;See FIG. 6&#34; in FIG. 5. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS \\n     The headbox shown in FIG. 1 comprises a mixing and distribution section, which consists of a large-scale mixing stage 1, a rectifier stage 2 and a fine-scale mixing stage 3, and a delivery nozzle 4 composed of converging top and bottom walls terminating in a slice opening 5. Stock is delivered to the headbox from a cross-machine distributor 6 through a number of stock feed pipes or hoses 7. \\n     The large-scale mixing stage of the headbox is simply an open chamber which receives stock at relatively high velocity from inlets from the pipes 7, which pipes may be anywhere from about 1 inch to 3 inches in diameter and spaced on a center-to-center distance of about twice the diameter. The entry of the streams of stock into the mixing chamber produces fairly intense, large-scale eddies and some degree of cross flow to provide mixing and distribution of the stock on a large scale. The chamber is made large enough so that the average velocity of flow through it is relatively low and flow disturbances resulting from velocity variations within the flow in the stage 1 will have only a negligibly small effect on conditions in the rectifier stage 2. The turbulence in the large-scale mixing stage keeps the lower (upstream) surface of the tube bank (described below) clean and free from lumps of stock that might otherwise build up on the entrance edges of the tubes. \\n     The rectifier stage 2 consists of an array of tubes 8, each of which is of relatively small diameter and great length. In particular, the lengths of the tubes are sufficiently long to substantially eliminate any cross flow tendency that may exist in the flow as it leaves the mixing stage 1. In general, the tubes should have a length of not less than 5 times the hydraulic diameter and preferably a length of at least 15 times the hydraulic diameter. The tubes 8 extend between a pair of transverse plates 11 and 12 (see FIGS. 3 and 4) that are spaced from each other in the flow direction and are strongly secured to the perimeter walls of the headbox, thus to impart rigidity and strength to the headbox. The tubes are arranged in diagonally extending rows that are centered between plates or lamellae 9 of the fine-mixing stage 3 (described below and see FIG. 3), the tubes in each row being equidistant from each other and the rows being equidistant from each other. Generally, the spacings between the tubes in each row will be somewhat greater than the spacings between the rows, a situation that is controlled by the construction and mode of operation of the fine-mixing stage 3. The overall pattern of the tubes should, of course, be such as to provide an even distribution of stock flow across the headbox. \\n     It is advantageous from the point of view of strength and rigidity of the headbox to install stiffeners 13 extending diagonally parallel to and between the tube columns in the shorter direction between opposite walls of the headbox and extending in the flow direction (axially) between the tube-mounting plates 11 and 12. \\n     The fine-mixing stage 3 is a section of the headbox containing a series of planar lamellae 9. The lamellae are oriented parallel to the axis of the fine-mixing stage in the flow direction and oblique to an axial-transverse medial plane of the fine-mixing stage, thus to form a multiplicity of narrow separate flow passages that lie parallel to the axis of the headbox and oblique to the cross-machine direction. Each row of tube outlets 10 is located parallel to and centered between an adjacent pair of the lamellae. \\n     The flow conditions and the mixing action that occur in the fine-mixing stage 3 of the headbox are shown very schematically in FIG. 2. The streams of stock established by flow through the tubes 8 in the rectifier stage enter the fine-mixing stage at a relatively high velocity and upon encountering the stock in the fine-mixing stage, which is flowing at a substantially lower velocity, form relatively small eddies B of low to medium intensity. Because the spacing between the lamellae is relatively small, the eddies tend to become aligned parallel to the lamellae so that the overall flow in each passage between adjacent lamellae is made up predominantly of eddies circulating in planes generally parallel to the lamellae. The eddies move at relatively low average, superficial velocity in the direction of the tubes of the tube bank, preferably in the range of from about 2 to 5 feet per second, up through the passages between the lamellae. The interaction of the eddies as they are generated and move slowly through the fine-mixing stage provides a very effective fine-scale mixing action of relatively long duration. The skewed orientations of the passages between the lamellae also provide an opportunity for some cross flow to occur, thereby tending to eliminate any residual cross flow tendencies. The spacing between the lamellae 9, the distances between outlets 10 of the tubes in each row between adjacent lamellae, and the diameters of the tubes should be such that the eddies formed in the fine-mixing stage circulate on the average through several revolutions before leaving the fine-mixing stage. \\n     The lamellae should, of course, be suitably fastened at each end to the walls of the headbox. The fact that the lamellae are oriented oblique to the axial-transverse medial plane of the fine-mixing stage makes them of relatively short length. Thus, they can be made of thin sheet material while still being sufficiently strong and durable to endure the relatively low intensity flow conditions of the stock as it moves through the passages between them. The heights of the lamellae in the flow direction should be not less than about 3, and preferably at least 5 times the perpendicular distance between them, which distance should be of the order of 3/4 inch. \\n     Upon leaving the fine-mixing stage 3, the stock enters the delivery nozzle 4 and in so doing makes a turn through a substantial angle, preferably of from about 60\\u00b0 to 85\\u00b0. The stock leaves the fine-mixing stage at a relatively low velocity and essentially free of large-scale turbulence and thus is able to make the turn into the nozzle with a minimum of disturbance in the flow. \\n     As depicted schematically in FIG. 2, the combined flow C of stock entering the nozzle 4 is, at any given cross-machine direction, made up of &#34;samples&#34; of stock that are &#34;peeled&#34; away successively from adjacent passages between the lamellae 9 in the fine-mixing stage. In making the abrupt turn from the fine-mixing stage to the nozzle, the eddies tend to be broken up. The stock flow in the nozzle tends, however, to remain layered with little physical intermixing of the layers, but the successive sampling effect of the peeling of stock flows from each passage in the fine-mixing stage produces additional mixing of the stock in the sense of combining in the nozzle elements of stock flowing from the different passages at different times. Thus, an element of stock flowing from portions of passages between the lamellae near the back of the headbox, relative to the slice opening 5, combines successively with elements of stock flowing from portions of the passages nearer the slice opening. \\n     The length of the nozzle should be as short as possible in order to provide fast acceleration of the stock to the slice opening with a minimum of turbulence generation resulting from hydraulic shear adjacent the walls of the nozzle. On the other hand, the distance between the slice opening and the landing position of the jet in the former should be kept small. Therefore, the nozzle will generally be of a length that requires convergence of the nozzle walls at angles \\u03b1 (see FIG. 1) of from about 2\\u00b0 to 6\\u00b0. The top and bottom walls of the nozzle may, if desired, be curved rather than straight. \\n     Referring to FIG. 5 of the drawings, a headbox, according to the present invention, may be constructed to deliver a jet composed of separate layers of stock (separate in that there is little co-mingling between the stocks of the layers at the interfaces between them) for the production in the former of a multi-ply web. In the embodiment of FIG. 5, the distribution and mixing section of the headbox is composed, in essence, of three compartments separated from each other by divider walls 20 and 21 in the large-scale mixing stage 1 and the fine-mixing stage 3, such divider walls extending axially and transversely to form separate cross-machine compartments. Stock is delivered from separate distributors 6 through separate pipes 7 to the different compartments. Similarly, the delivery nozzle 4 is subdivided by divider walls 14 that extend transversely and in the flow direction and define three passages converging at angles \\u03b1 1 , \\u03b1 2 , and \\u03b1 3 . \\n     In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the divider walls 14 in the nozzle are stainless steel plates bent at their upstream ends to form flanges 16 (see FIG. 6). Each divider wall 14 is fastened at its upstream end to a holder formed by a jaw 22 provided on the upper end of the divider wall 21 of the fine-mixing stage and a jaw 17 fastened by screws 19 to the jaw 22. The flange 16 of the divider wall 14 is received and held in a slot 15 in the jaw 22 by a rod 18 that presses down on top of the divider wall 14 within the opening between the jaws. The divider walls 14 extend downstream in the nozzle and terminate a short distance, say about 2 inches, from the slice opening 5. Thus, the layers of stock are maintained separate until just before the stock is discharged through the slice opening. \\n     In order to prevent warping of the divider walls 14 in the cross-machine direction, it is advantageous to construct and orient the jaws 17 and 22 in such a way that the divider walls 14 are held in positions in which they do not line up exactly in the direction of stock flow but point slightly below the slice opening. The hydraulic forces of the stock flow will then slightly bend the separating walls 14, and the imposed curvature, as depicted schematically by the arrowed lines &#34;R&#34; in FIG. 6, in the &#34;vertical&#34; direction (&#34;vertical&#34; as related to the drawings of FIGS. 5 and 6) will effectively prevent warping of the walls 14 in the cross-machine direction. \\n     The form of divider walls 14 and the manner of installing them in the nozzle in the embodiment of FIGS. 5 and 6 are merely exemplary of various ways in which the delivery nozzle of the headbox can be subdivided into separate channels, and various other ways, including some that are known in the art, may be employed. For example, the divider walls may be tapered plates that are of substantial thickness at their upstream ends, tapered to thin tips or sharp edges at their downstream ends, the mounted on pivots or connected by hinge-type connections to supports, such as the tops of the divider walls 21, at the entrance to the nozzle. \\n     The tendency for fiber orientation in the web to reflect the orientation of the lamellae in the fine-mixing stage of a headbox constructed in accordance with the present invention can be used to considerable advantage in a multiply headbox of the type shown in FIG. 5. In particular, the lamellae in the fine-mixing stage of one compartment can be oriented at a substantially different angle, preferably an angle of the opposite hand from the lamellae in other compartments. Thus, as shown in FIG. 5, the lamellae in the center compartment of the fine-mixing stage are oriented at an angle that is of a hand opposite from that of the lamellae in the outer compartments. The web formed of stock delivered from the headbox 5 will have fibers in the outer two layers oriented differently from the fibers of the middle layer, and the web will have a stiffness and strength greater than the sums of the stiffnesses and strengths of the individual layers and other mechanical properties that are enchanced by a &#34;plywood&#34; effect. \\n     In some cases, it may be desirable to provide turning vanes at the intersection between the distribution and mixing section and the delivery nozzle of the headbox. In such cases, a construction very similar to that shown in FIG. 5, but with divider walls that extend only a few inches downstream from the end of the fine-mixing section into the delivery nozzle, can be provided. With such a construction, the layers delivered from the separate compartments of the fine-mixing stage will intermix to a somewhat greater extent than in the multi-ply configuration illustrated in FIG. 5. Similarly, the extent of intermixing of layers in a multiply configuration is subject to some control by varying the lengths of the divider walls 14 in the downstream direction, i.e., by varying the distance between the downstream ends of the divider walls and the slice opening. To this end, the divider walls may be built and installed in a manner that permits adjustment of the distance between the downstream tips of the divider walls and the slice opening.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates to a false twist crimping machine of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,809,494, 3,962,829 and Re. No. 30,159. \\n     False twist crimping machines serve to crimp endless thermoplastic filament yarns. Such filament yarns are initially spun as flat yarns, and in the false twist crimping machine, a plurality of yarns are processed in side by side parallel working stations. More particularly, each yarn is initially withdrawn from its supply package by a first feed system, then heated in a heater to about 220\\u00b0 C., subsequently cooled, and then advanced through a false twist unit. A second feed system withdraws the yarn from the false twist unit. \\n     The above described false twist method results in a permanent crimp being imparted to the yarn. Crimp values (in accordance with DIN [German Industrial Standards] 53840) amount to 40-50%. However, in many applications, attempts are made to reduce this final crimp behavior substantially. To this end, a secondary heating tube is used at each processing station. This heating tube is arranged between the second and a third feed system, and in the known false twist crimping machine, each tube externally heated. For heating, a heated vapor is preferably used, which achieves a uniformity of heating among the stations. \\n     The effect of the heating tube is dependent on the method parameters of the heating zone. Decisive parameters are in particular the speed of the third feed system, the temperature of the heating tube, as well as its length. A certain deceleration of the yarn speed is generally provided by the third feed system, so as to reduce the yarn tension in the secondary heating tube. However, this deceleration, i.e. the speed difference between the second feed system and third feed system should not become too great, inasmuch as the yarn will slacken and result in yarn breakage. Furthermore, the threadline will become unstable, which leads to so-called voids, i.e. unevennesses of the yarn which later becomes visible in the fabric formed from the yarn. \\n     It is accordingly an object of the present invention to improve and intensify the heating effect of the secondary heating tube of a yarn false twist crimping machine, by a novel design and construction of the heating tube. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention are achieved in the embodiments illustrated herein by the provision of a yarn false twist crimping machine which comprises means for advancing a yarn along a path of travel, and false twist crimping means disposed along the path of travel and including means for serially heating, cooling, and false twisting the advancing yarn. Heat setting means is disposed along the path of travel downstream of the false twist crimping means, which comprises a heating tube and a non-heated transport tube fixed to the downstream end of said heating tube. The transport tube has an inside diameter which closely corresponds in size to the inside diameter of the heating tube, and such that the advancing yarn passes serially through the heating tube and the transport tube. \\n     In a preferred embodiment, the machine includes a central frame, and a side frame which is laterally spaced from the central frame so as to define a service aisle therebetween. The false twisting means of each station is mounted on the central frame, and the heating tube is also mounted on the central frame in a generally upright orientation. Also, the non-heated transport tube extends in a generally horizontal direction laterally across the service aisle adjacent the floor and to the side frame, and yarn winding means is mounted on the side frame for receiving the advancing yarn from the transport tube and winding the same into a package. \\n     The present invention has the advantage that in comparison with currently known heater designs, it is possible to operate with a considerably increased deceleration. Furthermore, with the same heating effect, it is possible to reduce the temperatures substantially, which results in a protective treatment of the yarn and savings of energy. A heater temperature of about 180\\u00b0 allows crimping values (for example, 12%) to be reached, which can be reached in conventional heaters only with temperatures of more than 200\\u00b0. \\n     In accordance with the present invention, the actual heating tube may be constructed of a considerably shorter length than in the past. A substantially sealed, preferably seamless connection is provided with the transport tube, which is not externally heated and which, as experience shows, need not be even insulated, and allows a heat compensation to occur within the entire cross section of the yarn, which replaces by sections the conventional, active heating of the yarn. The connection of the transport tube, which is here described as sealing or seamless, does not mean that the two tubes merge into one another without discontinuity, but that access of air is absent at the transition from one tube to the other. \\n     The very great length of the heating tube including the transport tube necessitate an operator-friendly construction. This problem is solved by the provision of a central frame and a laterally separated side frame, in the manner described above. \\n     It is important that too high of a yarn tension build up be avoided in the transport tube or at the connector between the heating tube and the transport tube, at which the yarn path is turned from a substantially vertical to a substantially horizontal direction. This is accomplished with the features of the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     Some of the objects and advantages of the present invention having been stated, others will appear as the description proceeds, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which \\n     FIG. 1 is a cross sectional schematic view of a false twist machine designed and constructed in accordance with the invention; \\n     FIG. 2 is a cross sectional schematic view of a false twist machine of the present invention, and illustrating a first embodiment of a device for threading the yarn into the heating and transport tubes; and \\n     FIG. 3 is a cross sectional schematic view of a false twist crimping machine of the present invention, and illustrating a different embodiment for threading a yarn through the heating and transport tubes. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \\n     Referring more particularly to the drawings, a false twist crimping machine is schematically illustrated in FIG. 1, which embodies the present invention. The machine comprises a creel (not shown) which supports a feed yarn package 10, on which a thermoplastic filament yarn 12 is wound. The yarn 12 is withdrawn via deflecting rolls 14 under a certain tension by a feed system 18. In the direction of the advancing yarn, downstream of feed system 18, a first, elongate heater 20 is arranged, through which the yarn 12 advances, and in so doing is heated to a certain temperature. Subsequent to heater 20, a further deflecting yarn guide 22 is positioned, which deflects the yarn and advances it to a cooling plate 24. Heater 20 and cooling plate 24 may be oriented relative to one another approximately in the fashion of a roof, with deflection yarn guide 22 forming the apex of the rooflike structure. Located downstream of cooling plate 24 is a schematically illustrated false twist unit 28. The latter may be designed and constructed in accordance with DE-PS 22 13 881 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,339,915. Subsequent to false twist unit 28, a further feed system 30 is positioned, which serves to draw yarn 12 both over heater 20 and cooling plate 24. \\n     In direction of ,the advancing yarn, downstream of feed system 30, a heating tube 34 is positioned, which is constructed preferably as a curved, tubular member which is surrounded by a heating jacket 32. The heating tube 34 may alternatively be constructed as a linear tube. The heating jacket 32 serves to heat the tube 34 from its outside with vapor at a certain elevated temperature. Adapted to the spatial conditions of the false twist crimping machine, the heating tube 34 and its jacket 32 are preferably arranged in an upright orientation. \\n     Seamlessly connected to the downstream or lower end of the heating tube 34, i.e. substantially sealed against air, is a transport tube 42. This allows for the yarn 12 to transport the atmosphere of heating tube 34 into transport tube 42. A connecting member 38 is provided to interconnect the downstream end of the heating tube 34 to the upstream end of the transport tube 42, and at the right angled elbow in the member there is provided a yarn guide 44 which is constructed as a pin or roll which has a circumferential groove. The groove serves to guide the yarn 12 with the least possible friction from heating tube 34 into the transport tube 42. Surprisingly, it has been found that the heated air entrained by yarn 12 from the heating tube 34 leads to a further reduction of the crimp imparted to yarn 12 in false twist zone 28, despite the relatively low temperature of the heating tube 34, for example, approximately 160\\u00b0 to 180\\u00b0 C., than has been possible with known heating tubes. \\n     At the outlet end of the transport tube 42, a further yarn feed system 46 is positioned. The latter may be followed by a device (not shown) for applying a finish to the yarn 12. The yarn is then wound into a takeup package 50, which is driven on its circumference by a friction roll 52. Arranged upstream of friction roll 52 is a traversing system 54, by which yarn 12 is reciprocated along package 50 and taken up so as to form a cross wind. \\n     Higher temperatures make it possible to obtain lower crimps, for example 12%, which otherwise can be obtained only with heating tubes of a greater length. This results in a better utilization of heat and savings of energy. \\n     It should also be noted that an insulation of the transport tube 42 has been found to be unnecessary, and often not even desirable, so as to bring the yarn at the end of the tube to a temperature below 100\\u00b0 C. \\n     Arranged above the transport tube 42 is a platform 56 which is supported by rails or posts 58 on the floor 60, and which serves as an operator walkway. \\n     In a preferred embodiment, the machine of the present invention comprises a central frame, shown schematically at 64 in FIG. 1, which mounts the false twist device 28, the feed rolls 30 and the upright heating tube 34 and its jacket 32. A side frame, shown schematically at 65, is also provided which is laterally spaced from the central frame so as to define a service aisle therebetween. The side frame 65 supports the package take-up system 52, 54, and it is positioned between the creel (not shown) for the package 10 and the service aisle at 56. As will be seen from the drawings, the heater 20 and the cooling plate 24 are positioned above the service aisle. \\n     The false twist crimping machine shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 corresponds entirely to the machine of FIG. 1, the description of which is herewith referred to. The machine of FIG. 2, however, differs from that of FIG. 1, in that at the outlet end of transport tube 42 a mouthpiece or outlet end 47 is provided in the form of a funnel-shaped widening of the tube. If the need arises, a suction nozzle or orifice 48 of a suction gun 62 which is connected via conventional hoses with a source of vacuum, may be applied to this mouthpiece 47, so as to pull a yarn through heating tube 34 and transport tube 42, as is common practice at the beginning of a new winding operation. To this end, the end of yarn 12 advancing from feed yarn package 10 is pulled in a simple step to the inlet end of heating tube 34 and then pulled with suction gun 62 through both tubes 34 and 42. Thereafter, the yarn 12 advances via the feed system 46 to the traversing system 54 and then to takeup package 50. \\n     The machine of FIG. 3 differs from that of FIG. 2 in that it is provided with a different yarn threading device. In this embodiment, the latter is a device operated by overpressure. To this end, a source of compressed air 36 is connected to a duct 38 via a tube 40. The tube 40 is provided with a valve 37, and extends behind the junction of the heating tube and the transport tube. Upon opening the valve 37, a surge of compressed air flows via duct 38 through the transport tube 42, which produces in heating tube 34 a suction effect. The latter allows the yarn 12 to be drawn or blow through the heating and transport tubes, when the yarn is held in front of the inlet end of heating tube 34. \\n     The heating tube 34 generally corresponds in its dimensions with respect to diameter and length to the dimensions of transport tube 42. The transport tube 42 is unheated, but is heated to a certain degree by the hot air entrained from the heating tube 34 by the advancing yarn 12. However, the influence of the heat decreases continuously from the inlet end to the outlet end of transport tube 42, which is possibly contributory to the unexpectedly advantageous effect provided by the transport tube. \\n     In a preferred embodiment, the dimensions of heating tube and transport tube are identical, except that the heating tube 34 is curved, for example, by a radius ranging from 4 to 10 meters. This curvature causes the advancing yarn to engage the inside portion of the bore of the heating tube, as seen in the drawings. The transport tube is substantially linear. The length of each tube is between 1 meter and 1.5 meters, and the inside diameter of each tube is between 3 and 12 millimeters. \\n     As one specific example, the heating tube 34 measured 1300 mm long and had an inside diameter of 4 mm. The transport tube 42 measured 1300 mm long and had an inside diameter of 4 mm. \\n     In the drawings and specifications, there has been set forth a preferred embodiment of the invention, and although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7116,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"A loom system, comprises a basic machine a heald loom, or a Jacquard machine, whereby the basic machine is coupled with the heald loom or with the Jacquard machine.

        [0016]    In a class of this embodiment, the seismic and energy-dissipation connector comprises a bolt, the wallboard mount comprises a bolt sleeve disposed in the integral composite prefabricated external wallboard, the bolt passes through a screw hole on the main frame and is connected to the bolt sleeve whereby fixing the integral composite prefabricated external wallboard on

main frame. \\n         [0018]    In a class of this embodiment, integral composite prefabricated external wallboards on the same storey are planarly connected. \\n         [0019]    In a class of this embodiment, integral composite prefabricated external wallboards on different stories are clutch connected, and the connection is caulk sealed. \\n         [0020]    In a class of this

\\n         [0021]    In a class of this embodiment, the integral composite prefabricated external wallboard comprises a structure layer, at least one light-weight filling block disposed on an inner side of the structure layer, and a heat insulation layer, the heat insulation layer is attached to an outer side of the light-weight filling block, the structure layer is disposed on a lateral outside

method for producing an energy-saving house, comprising performing foundation construction of the energy-saving house, installing a main frame, disposing an integral composite prefabricated external wallboard on the main frame, installing multiple floor cover plates and top cover plates on different stories, installing a pipeline system, a prefabricated bathroom, a stair and an enclosed wall, and installing a facing of an inner wall and other accessories. \\n         [0024]    Components of a main part of the house, such as the main frame, the floor cover plate, the top cover plate and the enclosed wall are prefabricated except for a basic part of the house, and thus industrial production is realized. Construction of the house is implemented by industrially produced components and products and processes such as field installation, connection, modification and so on. At the time a base of the house is constructed, factory production of various house component is performed. After the base is constructed, the main frame, the floor cover plate, the top cover plate and the enclosed wall are installed. The invention reduces a great deal of field work, and storey structure and external wall construction do not need a large amount of support frames and scaffolds, which saves energy consumption, water consumption, construction land and construction materials, and reduces construction noise and dust and construction time. Standardization and integration of house components and products are beneficial for application of new technology and materials and renewable energy such as solar energy. For example, solar devices are disposed on roofs, balconies and sunny sides of wall, or outside the structure layer, and the house is capable of improving residence comfort and increasing available use area, reducing consumption of energy and water, and thus facilitating a green house and green construction. Moreover, the invention is capable of implementing standardization, serialization and finalization, house drawing libraries, performing house design via digital management, and presenting architectural styles and aesthetic perception via design techniques such as difference of house layout, modeling of balconies, materials of decorative surface, color configuration and so on. \\n         [0025]    The main frame of the invention may employ a steel frame since steel is a renewable material that features good technical performance and ductility and capable of improving structural bearing capacity and seismic performance. Various steel components are easy for large-scale production, and feature high production efficiency and high product quality in manufacturing. With increasing demand for steel, to construct houses with steel is a development trend. \\n         [0026]    The floor cover plate and the top cover plate are light-weight laminated slabs. The light-weight laminated slab uses a hollow stripe board made of prefabricated and reinforced light aggregate concrete as a substrate to replace a traditional process of laying wooden formworks for a floor cover plate and a top cover plate made of cast-in-situ concrete. The substrate is disposed on a special tool-typed support frame to replace a support headframe. A reinforced skeleton tablet is disposed between the substrates, a reinforced net is disposed on an upper surface of the substrate, and the reinforced skeleton tablet and the reinforced net are casted via C30-grade fine-stone concrete to form the light-weight laminated slab. Since the hollow stripe board can be directly disposed on a main frame that is already constructed via the tool-typed support frame, the number of bottom formworks and supports is reduced, which improves production efficiency, reduces effect to surrounding environment, and overcomes limitation of storey-by-storey construction. After the main frame is constructed, construction can be performed from any storey upwardly or downwardly, or from multiple stories simultaneously whereby reducing construction time. After the light-weight laminated slab is formed, the only wet construction process - filed concrete casting is performed. After consolidation, the light-weight laminated slab is firmly combined with the main frame to form a combined structure interacted by a composite concrete floor cover or top cover and the main frame and bearing different acting force of the house. Construction of the light-weight laminated slab does not need to dismount a top bracing, a form spacer and a hoisting machine, and decreases some dominant processes. Moreover, the hollow stripe board, the reinforced skeleton tablet and the reinforced net can be directly processed in factories based on standards and transmitted to a construction field for installation, which greatly improves production efficiency, reduces construction time and helps to implement industrialization of manufacturing. \\n         [0027]    The integral composite prefabricated external wallboard of the invention comprises a structure layer, a light-weight filling block, and a heat insulation layer. The structure layer is a reinforced (the reinforced skeleton tablet and the reinforced net) concrete layer in the shape of a rib, and disposed on an outer side and surrounding of a wall board, and in a gap of the light-weight filling block, which makes the structure layer capable of bearing external force, climate change and rain erosion. \\n         [0028]    In factories, materials with good heat insulation performance and light weight, and post-casting, high-strength, waterproof and fine-stone concrete of the reinforced net are casted with doors and windows to form an integral external wallboard. After inside and outside decoration, the integral external wallboard is transmitted to the field for installation, which replaces traditional processes such as installing scaffolds, house walls, decorating and so on. The integral composite prefabricated external wallboards can be installed sequentially and upwardly with the main frame or on different stories simultaneously after the main frame is constructed. A supporting plate is disposed on a supporting point of the main frame, multiple positioning holes are disposed on the external wallboard are aligned with positioning pins disposed on the supporting plate, which makes it easy for adjacent integral composite prefabricated external wallboards to be positioned. After positioning, high-strength bolts are used for tightening and fixing via optimized fastening force, and a damping pad is disposed in a gap between the integral composite prefabricated external wallboard and the main frame. Pressure is generated after the bolt is tightened, under the action of the pressure, the damping pad is worn and deformed, and therefore is capable of implementing a seismic and energy dissipation effect, reducing force applied by an earthquake to the house, and improving seismic performance of the house. Integral composite prefabricated external wallboards on different stories are clutch connected, which is beneficial for stabilization and firmness of installation of the external wallboard. Ends of integral composite prefabricated external wallboards on the same storey are parallel connected. Connection between integral composite prefabricated external wallboards on different stories and that on the same storey are caulk sealed to improve a sealing effect. A pair of vertical slots is disposed on both ends of the connection between integral composite prefabricated external wallboards on the same storey and form a cavity, which increases space of caulk sealing, guarantees tight connection between the integral composite prefabricated external wallboards, facilitates a rain-proof and anti-seepage effect, and keeps warm and prevents colds. A joint between the integral composite prefabricated external wallboards is disposed on the main frame, which helps to perform caulk sealing of the integral composite prefabricated external wallboards and ensures connecting quality. \\n         [0029]    The integral composite prefabricated external wallboard is an integral external wallboard made based on a dimension of one room, namely one integral composite prefabricated external wallboard is an external wall of one room. The reinforced concrete is C30-grade and has a seepage-resistant grade of P6. The light-weight filling block is light-weight-material prefabricated plate with a bulk density less or equal to 500 kg/m 2  with certain strength. The light-weight filling block is dispose on an inner side of the integral composite prefabricated external wallboard whereby reducing an overall weight of the external wallboard and insulating (absorbing) sound. A squeezed foam board has a very low heat transfer coefficient, and is disposed on a middle portion of the integral composite prefabricated external wallboard as a heat insulation layer and operates as a heat insulation material for the wall. An external-wall door and a window frame are disposed in a mould before concrete is casted, so that the door and the window frame are firmly disposed in the wall, which improves weatherability of the door and the window frame.

Construction time of traditional field construction is long as being limited by a main construction procedure, procedures of the invention can be performed simultaneously and construction time thereof is reduced by 40-50%. As construction time is extended for one month, interest cost is increased by 1%-2%.

Structure Loading Test on the Floor Cover Plate Made by the Light-Weight Laminated Slab \\n         [0088]    The loading test aims at testing stress of relevant positions of the floor cover structure (containing the steel beam of the floor cover) under the action of loading, and deforming and crack development of the structure part. The test is conducted by Shenzhen Institute of House Research Co., Ltd, and test report is also written thereby. \\n         [0000]    Test basis: Standard Methods for Testing of Concrete Structures (China national standard GB50152-92) \\n         [0089]    The floor cover plate employs a bi-directional plate (bi-directional forced) with a span of 4 m\\u00d74.5 m, and a unidirectional plate (unidirectional forced) with a span of 2.5 m. The loading test is conducted for two times, the first loading test comprises a scenario where stress of surrounding supporting steel beams varies as the floor cover made of laminated slabs is constructed, loading is stopped as a load value of the unidirectional plate is twice than a designed standard load value. Mid-span deflection of the plate is only 0.84 mm (L o /2976), mid-span stress of a plate rib is 32 N /mm 2 , and negative reinforcement stress of a support is 54 N /mm 2 . \\n         [0090]    As a load value of the bidirectional late is 4.2 times than a designed standard load value and a first crack appears, loading is stopped. Short mid-span deflection of the plate is 4.32 mm (L o /926), and long mid-span deflection of the plate is 6.35 mm (L o /710). \\n         [0091]    Central Reinforced Stress:\\n       short mid-span stress of a plate rib 61 N /mm 2      long mid-span stress of a plate rib 52 N /mm 2      short negative reinforcement of a support 54 N /mm 2      long negative reinforcement of a support 32.4 N /mm 2          \\n \\n         [0096]    To demonstrate bearing capability of the light-weight laminated plate to be damaged, another damage load test is conducted. \\n         [0097]    A unidirectional plate: load value thereof is 7.5 times than a designed standard load (namely 35 KN/m 2 ), the maximum mid-span deflection is 6.4 mm (L o /390), since loading blocks are highly piled, it is impossible to load any more. \\n         [0098]    A bi-directional plate: load value thereof is 13 times than a designed standard load (namely 32.5 KN/m 2 ), the mid-span deflection is 12.85 mm (L o /311), and a width of the crack at the bottom of the plate is 1.5 mm. At this time the floor cover plate is regarded as entering a plastic deforming phase. The test indicates the floor cover plate made of the light-weight laminated slab has high bearing capacitance and enough safety reservation. \\n         [0099]    2. Heat Resistance Test on the Integral Composite Prefabricated External Wallboard \\n         [0100]    The loading test and heat resistance test are conducted by Shenzhen Institute of House Research Co., Ltd, and test report is also written thereby. The test is based on China national standard GB/T13475-92 named \\u201cHouse Element-Determination of Steady-state Thermal Transmission Properties-Calibrated and guarded hot box\\u201d. A test equipment employs a BW-1212WT-type stable heat transmission test system JN002. \\n         [0101]    Test condition: air temperature in the hot box is 35\\u00b0 C., air temperature in the cool box is \\u221210\\u00b0 C. Air flow rate in the hot box is natural convection, and air flow rate in the cool box is 3 m/s. Heat transmission direction of samples is from warm to cool. Airflow direction in the cool box is upward. Emissivity on inner surface of the box is 0.85. The samples&#39; state is natural drying. \\n         [0102]    By comparison of heat resistance, materials such as the light-weight-material prefabricated plate, the squeezed form plate and so on are selected as materials having heat insulation effect in the laminated external wallboard. The reinforced net is casted via C30-grade fine-stone concrete and post-casted in an embedded form. After the heat resistance test, a thermal conductivity is 1.05 W/m\\u00b7K, which is less than an index of 1.5 W/m\\u00b7K defined by the Power-saving Standard for thermal conductivity of wall. \\n         [0103]    While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects, and therefore, the aim in the appended claims is to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.\",\n          \"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \\n     The present application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 481,607 filed Feb. 15, 1990, and entitled &#34;Building Panel and Method&#34; of the same inventor herein. \\n    \\n    \\n     1. Field of the Invention \\n     The present invention relates to building panels which may be used for roofing, or sidewalls, interior or exterior. The invention addresses itself specifically to a joint for such panels which interlocks adjacent panels and in which provision is made for sealing and locking the panels together. \\n     2. Summary of the Prior Art \\n     The prior art is represented by U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,963 issued Sept. 13, 1988, the patents cited therein such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,367,076; 3,479,784; 3,742,672; 3,760,548; and 4,373,312 as well as 2,682,938 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,963. \\n     The structures of the prior art do permit interlocking adjacent panels. The structure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,963 does an excellent job of interlocking but normally requires a direct press fit as distinguished from a rolling action which can be employed with a less precise joint. With all of the prior art patents, normally sealing is done after the panels are joined and at the seam. If the seam is tight, there is a problem in inserting the sealant at the seam where it can do its best job of bonding to adjacent edges together. Accordingly, the sealing often ends up as an exterior bead which, while acceptable for purposes of securing against leakage particularly where a joint is tight, it is less attractive than an unsealed closely abutting seam. Therefore, what is needed is a joint between adjacent panels in which sealant can be the subject of provision internally of the joint, and yet the sealant is assured to give the joint watertight integrity. \\n     In order to preseal with the construction shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,963, there would have to be a shortening of the U-shaped structures 34 which would result in the end of the U-shaped structure not bottoming out in the channel 36 of edge 32. Therefore, from a standpoint of centering two adjacent panels, reliance must be had on the edge 24 of the core 16 projecting into the edge 22 of core 16 in an interlocking relationship between the foamed material in the dish-like geometry of end 24 and end 22. Thus the lateral stability as a function of the skin to provide for a centering relationship of the adjacent panels would be sacrificed if provision is made for a sealant pocket in the channel 36. This reinforces the desirability of providing for a sealant channel without sacrificing the centering ability of the roll-formed skin as distinguished from relying on the center foam portions to provide such centering. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention derives from a joint, in one embodiment, between adjacent panels of sheet encased insulating material in which one lateral edge has an essentially frustoconical nose, and the other edge has a frustoconical pocket. In an alternative embodiment, essentially frustoconical noses are at both lateral edges and the two adjacent panels are joined by means of an I beam embodying the interlock of the present invention. In both embodiments, the interlocking relationship is a function of the lateral edges of the cladding sheet, or the flange of an I beam, in which one edge has a sealant pocket, and the opposite edge has a locking sealant press which engages the sealant pocket and thereby interlocks the panels as well as presses the sealant in the sealant pocket to compress and secure the same and to form a sealant gasket between the lateral edges of the sealant pocket and the locking sealant press. The method of the invention contemplates the steps of providing adjacent building panels with sealant pockets in a seal press, and thereafter filling the sealant pocket with a predetermined amount of sealant to the end that when the joints are compressed together, there will be sufficient excess sealant material to be extruded by the sealant press lock to form gaskets or fins between the sidewalls of the sealant pocket and the sidewalls of the locking sealant press. The invention further contemplates the provision of a stabilizer reversely folded on one edge of the sealant press to overly and snap-fittingly and centeringly engage the adjacent ramp. In essence the two opposed stabilizers serve as a vice to grip the two opposed ramps when the adjacent panels are assembled with the sealant in the sealant pocket. \\n     In view of the foregoing it is a principal object of the present invention to provide building panels of the type which are essentially a sheet encased insulating core with opposed lateral edges which permit the same to be readily secured to each other, and also to accommodate a sealant which is interior of the joint, not exposed at the exterior seam, and yet has the structural and sealant integrity to secure against moisture penetration, air leakage, and other flow through the joint. \\n     Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a joint between adjacent structural panels which does not require significantly increased amounts of insulating material or sheet cladding, and which can be formed with roll formed presses or extruders of the kind known in the art. \\n     Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a joint which will lockingly receive an adjacent panel, lockingly secure sealant in place, and yet provide for dimensional stability of the completed joint and sections of adjacent panels which permits the structure to be erected with modular panels knowing that the modular dimensions of the roof or sidewalls will be predetermined with accuracy based upon the coaction between the adjacent building panels. As a corollary, another objective is to utilize such a joint in which a vice-like relationship is achieved between the two opposing lateral edges at the joint and adjacent the sealant pocket. \\n     A further and important objective of the present invention is to provide a joint as described which can be enjoyed in the construction of a flush mounted I beam which join the opposed edges of adjacent panels and thereby impart a significantly improved span capability with an attractive flush joint, and four sealing pockets as distinguished from the two where no I beam is employed. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     The present invention including the apparatus and method will be better understood as the following description proceeds taken in conjunction with the accompanying illustrative drawings, in which: \\n     FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an illustrative house having an enclosed patio including doors and windows and which is constructed of panels illustrative of the present invention; \\n     FIG. 2 is an enlarged view of the enclosed patio portion of FIG. 1, and showing sequentially how the panels are placed into position; \\n     FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of an interlocking edge and sealant pocket showing the interlocking vice-like relationship between the edge and pocket; A,B,C, and D show progressive interlocking steps, without use of sealant, from initial contact to sliding and expanding at edges to final nesting; \\n     FIG. 4 is an illustrative partially broken view showing how the adjacent panels illustrative of the present invention can be assembled a rocking motion; \\n     FIG. 5 is a view in the same scale and perspective as FIG. 4 but illustrating how the illustrative panels can be assembled by thrusting one panel towards the other in the plane of the same; \\n     FIG. 6 along with FIG. 5 illustrates how the two adjacent panels may be assembled; \\n     FIG. 7 is a sectional view of assembled panels showing how the nose of one panel is received by the pocket of the adjacent panel and secured in place by means of the sealant pocket and locking sealant press; \\n     FIG. 8 is an enlarged view of the joint in FIG. 7, and showing more specifically the details as well as the location of the sealant material; \\n     FIG. 9 is a further enlarged view of a portion of FIG. 8 showing how the pre-seal bead is inserted into the sealant pocket prior to assembling the panels; \\n     FIG. 10 is a view sequential to FIG. 9 and illustrating how the sealant is compressed in the sealant pocket and how sealant gaskets are extruded to be adjacent the lateral edges of the sealant pocket and the sealant press thereby defining a gasket; \\n     FIG. 11 is an enlarged view of the sealant pocket and showing exemplary dimensions of the same; \\n     FIG. 12 is an enlarged view of the sealant press and showing exemplary dimensions of the same; \\n     FIG. 13 is an enlarged view of the lateral edge nose of one panel showing illustrative dimensions; \\n     FIG. 14 is an enlarged view of a lateral edge of the panel showing the nose pocket and showing illustrative dimensions; \\n     FIG. 15 is a transverse sectional view of two adjacent panels which are joined by an I beam employing the joint of the present invention; and \\n     FIG. 16 is an enlarged view of the end of the I beam and the two adjacent joints in enlarged scale taken essentially where shown as circled in the lower portion of FIG. 15. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \\n     The subject invention of a structural panel and joint will be best understood in the environment of its usage. One embodiment to be described first is of two adjacent panels 10 having a single joint at their lateral edges. An alternative embodiment utilizes an I beam to join two adjacent panels and at the web end joints there are essentially four joints illustrative of the present invention. Turning now to FIG. 1, it will be seen that a house A has been supplied with an enclosed patio B which includes doors C, windows D, and the structural panel 10 illustrative of the invention. Turning now to FIG. 2, it will be seen that the house A and the enclosed patio B are made up by sequentially positioning the panels 10 adjacent each other and lockingly securing the same by press-fittingly engaging their opposed lateral edges. A version of the prior art is shown U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,963 of Sept. 13, 1988 in which the adjacent panels do have an opposed tongue-and-groove type construction. On the other hand, means are not provided at the lateral edges for pre-assembly sealing and lockingly and dimensionally accurately securing and centering the adjacent panels. \\n     The panels illustrative of the first embodiment of the invention can be secured by sliding directly in opposed relationship, or rockingly engaging the one to the other. Such locking engagement sequence is illustrated in FIG. 3. FIG. 3a shows the locking sealant press 19 of one panel making initial contact with ramp 20 of an adjacent panel. FIG. 3b shows the locking sealant press 19 sliding up the ramp 20 21 and simultaneously flexing outward from the nose 15. FIG. 3C shows further sliding progression up the ramp 20 by the sealant press 19 and further outward expansion of the sealant press 19, reaching the final prelocking sliding position. FIG. 3D shows sealant press 19 snapped into sealant pocket 18 in vice-like locking relationship with sealant pocket 18. Such locking engagement is further illustrated in FIG. 4, where it will be seen that the panel 10 with its interior core 11 has the pocket 16 positioned opposite the nose 15 of the adjacent panel 10. The one panel is rocked with regard to the other until the locking pocket 18 is engaged by the locking sealant press 19 of the opposed panel as shown in the left-hand portion of FIG. 4. Thereafter, the panel is rotated essentially in the direction of the arrow as shown, until the opposite locking press 19 engages the opposed sealant pocket 18. In FIG. 5, the relationship of opposed panels is shown, and the arrow illustrates that the one panel 10 having a pocket 16 is moved in direct opposed parallel relationship to the opposite panel 10 toward the nose 15 and then the locking sealant presses 19, 19 substantially simultaneously fit into the sealant pockets 18. \\n     More specific details will be seen as the description of FIGS. 7 and 8 takes place. As will be seen in FIG. 7, the panel 10 is made up of a core material 11. This core material can be in a block of many thicknesses between one inch to eight inches in thickness. Commercial insulating grade of polystyrene is a desired material, but any material having comparable strength and insulating characteristics can be employed in a panel contemplated by the present invention. Such materials may include urethane, isocyranates, foamed or composite slabs, and honeycomb cores. The core 11 is covered by a skin 12 which is desirably laminated to the core 11. The skin 12 oftentimes is made up of aluminum having a thickness of 0.015 inches to 0.040 inches. While aluminum is a preferred material, other claddings including certain forms of plastics and steel are acceptable if they have the yieldable and formable characteristics at the joint portion. In addition, an aluminum encased steel sold under the trademark Galvalume is also an acceptable skin. In addition, the cladding or skin may be a composite. For example, an interior wall may have a formed metal joint at the lateral edge with laminated interior finished wall portion such as wood panel, dry wall, chip board, or even wall paper. Finally, it will be noted that the nose 15 is provided in one of the panels 10 and is essentially frustopyramedal in its cross-section. The opposite mating foam nose pocket 16 is similarly configured. While the two opposed members, namely nose 15 and pocket 16, have been shown in contact with each other, it is anticipated that a gap may be positioned between the nose 15 and the pocket 16, particularly because of the joint of the invention. \\n     Turning now to FIG. 8, there it will be seen that the panel 10 with its core 11 and skin 12 is recessed in order to provide for a reversely formed portion of the skin 12 to define the sealant pocket 18. The sealant pocket 18 has a nose side 24, a panel side 25, and a bottom 22 which joins the two sides and is in substantially perpendicular relationship to both of the sides. The sealant pocket 18 terminates with a ramp 20 which parallels one of the sidewalls of the nose 15. \\n     Opposite the sealant pocket is a locking sealant press 19 which press has a centering stabilizer 21 extending from the press portion and in substantially parallel relationship to the ramp 20. The sealant press 19 has a sealant press leading edge 28, and a sealant press trailing edge 29. The centering stabilizer 21 extends from the trailing edge 29. The centering stabilizer 21 is dimensioned so that, with its opposed centering stabilizer 21, it has a vice-like grip on the two adjacent ramps 20 to the end that centering of the two adjacent panels is assured, even though the locking sealant press bottom portion is spaced apart from the bottom 22 of the sealant pocket 18. \\n     Quite important to this construction is the slide corner 30 of the sealant press 19 which slidingly engages the adjacent ramp 20 as was described previously in connection with FIGS. 3, 4 and 5. When the joint is concluded, a flex pocket 31 remains interiorly of the lateral extending edges of the skin 12 which has been formed to define the locking sealant press 19. \\n     In accordance with the use of the present invention, a preseal material 32 is positioned in the sealant pocket 18 as shown in FIG. 9. This preseal 32 is proportioned to essentially fill the sealant pocket 18 to an amount somewhat in excess of the space which will be provided after the locking sealant press 19 has been inserted. Turning now to FIG. 10, it will be seen that after the locking sealant press 19 has been inserted, the residual is a compressed sealant 34 in the base of the sealant pocket 18, and sealant gaskets 35 which are extruded as the sealant press 19 enters the sealant pocket 18. The result is not only the sealant at the base of the sealant pocket which under some circumstances is more than adequate to insure against leakage, but in addition the sealant gaskets 35 are defined which further reduce the likelihood of moisture penetration even into the joint. Conversely, the sealant gasket does not extend beyond the opposed edges of the skin 12 of the adjacent panels, and therefore is hidden from view and the panel joint appears to be one of closely abutting skin end portions which are neatly positioned adjacent each other. Finally, a centering relationship between the two adjacent panels 10 is assured by the vice-like grip the opposed centering stabilizers 21 have with the adjacent ramps 20. \\n     The Method \\n     The method of the present invention presupposes the forming of structural panels in which opposed lateral edges have respectively a nose and a pocket 15, 16. The skin 12 portions of the opposed panels 10 are provided at their lateral edges with a sealant press extending from the nose pocket portion 16, and a sealant pocket 18 extending from the nose portion 15. The sealant pocket is filled with a bead of preseal 32 in an amount proportioned to exceed the ultimate available space between the bottom 22 of the sealant pocket, and the bottom of the locking sealant press 19. As the units are put together in accordance with the method, the compressed sealant 34 is defined in the sealant pocket 18, and portions of the sealing material are extruded to form sealant gaskets 35, between the opposed sidewalls of the locking sealant press 19 and the sealant pocket 18. \\n     While the precise dimensions of the subject panels are not considered a detailed part of the invention, for illustrative purposes they do exemplify the proportions of the opposed members. Normal commercial practice utilizes a panel having a center core portion of approximately three inches in thickness. Therefore, the following dimensions which are set forth relate to utilization with a three inch thick panel. The lateral edges do not vary, however, between thicknesses of one inch and eight inches inasmuch as the structural integrity of the lateral edges is substantially independent of the thickness of the foam 11. The dimensions which are set forth as follows are based upon the tolerances and the dimensions used for utility with a wide variety of thicknesses of core material 11. The dimensions are set forth to particularly show the ratios of the lengths, widths, and depths of the various elements of the joint. \\n     Thus, in FIG. 11, it will be seen that the depth of the pocket 18 is approximately 0.432 inches. The distance across the bottom 22 shown as reference numeral 51 is 0.25 to 0.50 inches. The depth of the nose wall of the pocket 18 identified as reference numeral 52 is between 0.187 and 0.25 inches. Finally, the ramp 20 shown as dimension 54 is between 0.25 and 0.50 inches. \\n     Turning now to FIG. 2, it will be seen that the locking press leading edge identified by reference numeral 55 is approximately 0.30 to 0.25 inches. The head portion 56 of the locking press 19 shown as reference numeral 56 is between 0.15 and 0.40 inches. The return portion 58 which terminates in the centering stabilizer 21 is approximately 0.125 inches. The length of the centering stabilizer 21 shown by reference numeral 59 is between 0.25 and 0.375 inches. \\n     For purposes of reference, the above dimensions shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 reference numerals 50-59 contemplate a insulating core material 11 which is approximately three inches thick. Thus turning to FIG. 13, the width of the core 11 is identified by reference numeral 60 and it is nominally to 8 inches. The pockets which are formed to receive the sealant pocket 18, 18&#39; are approximately 0.475 inches deep, and between 0.25 and 0.50 inches wide. The angle of the frustoconical portion with the parallel skin 12 identified by reference numeral 61 is between 45\\u00b0 and 60\\u00b0. The distance between the leading edge of the pocket 18&#39; and that portion which abuts the adjacent panel shown by reference numeral 62 is approximately 0.50 to 1.0 inches. \\n     The pocket 16 as shown in FIG. 14 is between 0.25 and 0.50 inches deep, and between 1.0 and 8.0 inches wide, with the two flat portions identified by reference numeral 64 being approximately 0.375 and 0.50 inches, and the angle of taper being the same as the angle of the nose identified by reference numeral 61 in the range of 45\\u00b0 to 60\\u00b0. \\n     The alternative embodiment panel shown in FIG. 15 will be described using identical reference numerals to the first embodiment just described, where applicable to show the commonality of invention and joint usage. It will be seen in FIG. 15 that the two adjacent panels 10 have a pair of noses 15 which oppose each other. An I beam 40 is provided with a central web 41, and a pair of flanges 42 at either end of the web 41. An optional elastomeric spanner 45 is provided at the central portion 46 of the I beam web 41. At the opposite ends of each of the spanners 42 provision is made for a sealant pocket 18, a locking sealant press 19, a ramp 20, a centering stabilizer 21, and a bottom 22. The leading edge 28, trailing edge 29, slide corner 30, flex pocket 31 are the same as described in the first embodiment. The adjacent panels 10 are joined in essentially the same fashion as illustrated in FIGS. 4, 5, and 6. The sealant is applied in essentially the same fashion as illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10. The I beam 40 is constructed with the flanges 42 so that the ends of the flanges 42 are flush with the skin 12 of the panel 10. The optional elastomeric member 45 is secured in the central area 46 of the web 41, and accommodates expansion and contraction where temperature differentials exist and thereby insures a flush fit. By utilizing the beam 40 significantly longer unsupported spans can be made, and the skin 12 can be reduced. The joint between the adjacent panels 10, however, is equally as well sealed as with the first embodiment and provision is made for four seals along with the flush mounted beam. The flush mounted beam 40 is made of varying thicknesses and the web 41 and flanges 42 can be of thicker material than those elements comprising the sealant press 19 and centering stabilizer 21. \\n     Although particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in full here, there is no intention to thereby limit the invention to the details of such embodiments. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternatives, embodiments, usages and equivalents as fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention, specification and appended claims.\",\n          \"REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \\n     This application is a corresponding non-provisional application and claims priority of provisional application Ser. No. 61/246,954, filed Sep. 29, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. \\n    \\n    \\n     FIELD OF THE INVENTION \\n     A vehicle restraint system is provided, which is comprised of an easily installable and transportable base having a deployable vehicle retention means contained therein. In particular, a rigid base over which vehicles may drive is provided, having a deployable vehicle retention means, such as a net or flexible panel, disposed in the base. In addition, deployable plates and tire puncturing devices are disposed in the base, to prevent movement of the vehicle. \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     For many years, a small number of companies have sold vehicle crash barriers primarily designed to thwart deliberate vehicle-based attacks of buildings. These barriers are generally heavy steel structures imbedded in concrete or concrete structures in a road surface that physically obstruct the roadway. These heavy steel structure devices are designed so that a barrier device (usually a steel plate) can be raised or lowered to control the ability of a vehicle to pass through or over the barrier and, thus, gain access to the building being secured. These devices differ from the barriers commonly encountered in parking garages and other public venues, in that they have very high stopping power, for example, preventing a 15,000-pound explosive laden truck traveling at 50 mph from passing beyond the vehicle barrier. \\n     Barriers come in numerous designs, but they can generally be categorized in three conventional types: plate, beam, and bollard. The plate barrier can be oriented to lay relatively flat on the surface of the roadway and be selectively actuated to be angled upwardly upon a perceived threat to form a wedge that restricts passage of a vehicle. The plate barrier is considered to be a permanently installed device as the plate is supported on a concrete encased frame that is buried into the surface of the roadway. A variation of the plate barrier has been introduced recently into the marketplace as a portable barrier. Another variation is to fasten the plate barrier to the roadway, such as with bolts. This barrier device is essentially a plate type barrier that is not imbedded in concrete, but instead can be moved to different locations to accommodate the need for temporary or changing security needs. Since the portable plate barrier is not imbedded in concrete, stopping power is relatively limited. \\n     The beam barrier incorporates a vertically movable beam that is typically pivotally supported at one end of the beam by a steel support that is imbedded in concrete to provide a relatively immovable object and at the opposing end by a similar steel support at the opposing side of the roadway. The beam barrier serves as a movable gate that can be raised vertically (or swung horizontally) to allow vehicles to pass or lowered into engagement with the steel supports at either end of the beam to provide a substantial resistance to the passage of any vehicle. As with the conventional plate barrier, the beam barrier provides a permanent installation and relatively high stopping power. Some beam barriers use bands of nylon or similar material that are contained within the hollow beam and wrapped around the pivot structure for the beam to increase the resistance of the steel beam. \\n     The bollards are typically permanently installed steel or concrete barriers that are typically not selectively movable, although vertical movement could be provided to permit the structure to rise into a passage restrictive position above the surface of the roadway, or be retracted into the ground to permit the passage of vehicles. Generally, bollards are a permanent structure that cannot be made portable without loss of substantial stopping power capabilities. \\n     Conventional barriers generally have a disadvantage inherent in their designs in that each barrier design requires active mechanical movement of very heavy structures. Heavy steel plates (plate barriers) or heavy cylinders (bollard barriers) have to be raised against gravity in order to stop vehicles. Further, current vehicle barriers require approximately two seconds for emergency activation from an open position in which the vehicle can pass by the barrier to a deployed position in which a vehicle is prevented from passing by or over the barrier. Activation times for conventional beam barriers and sliding gate barriers are even longer, averaging about ten seconds for barriers that are one traffic lane wide and substantially longer for larger two lane barriers. \\n     A vehicle traveling 50 mph covers 73 feet per second. Even if the barrier activation time is only two seconds, the facility needs to have almost 150 feet of standoff distance between the barrier close signal, such as from a guard or automated system, and the physical location of the barrier itself. Many facilities simply do not have the necessary space to accommodate this type of operation. This means that many existing barriers are seldom used in an \\u201cactivate only when needed\\u201d mode. Thus, the barrier is always up and must be lowered for every authorized vehicle. \\n     In addition, this constant raising and lowering of the vehicle barrier to allow authorized vehicle passage, over the course of its operating lifetime, requires a vehicle barrier to be cycled open and closed hundreds of thousands or even millions of times. Requiring constant movement from highly massive structures presents substantial challenges with respect to the maintenance and repair of vehicle barriers. Simply reducing the weight of the vehicle barrier is not a satisfactory resolution to these maintenance challenges as the stopping power of the vehicle barrier must be maintained. \\n     With regards to the prevention of terrorist attack in ever-changing locations, such as roadblocks or military field installations, conventional barrier systems are generally impractical, as they require extensive installation procedures. In addition, such conventional barrier systems are often unable to stop a large terrorist vehicle, such as a 25,000-pound explosive laden trash truck, as has been employed in Lebanon, in a sufficient distance to prevent tremendous damage to the terrorist&#39;s intended target. \\n     In view of the above mentioned disadvantages of conventional vehicle barrier systems, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved vehicle restraint system that is highly portable, manufacturable at a lower cost than conventional systems, easily controllable, requires a low level of maintenance, yet is a highly effective barrier for security purposes. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     In order to achieve the objects of the invention as described above, the present inventor earnestly endeavored to develop a vehicle restraint system capable of overcoming the disadvantages of the conventional vehicle barrier systems and vehicle restraint systems. Accordingly, a portable vehicle restraint system was developed, over which vehicles may pass freely until the system is actuated so as to deploy retention means therefrom, thereby securing the passing vehicle to the system and allowing the forward kinetic energy of the vehicle to be dissipated by sliding of the system relative to the ground. \\n     In particular, the vehicle retention system of the present invention is comprised generally of a portable base, having a quickly deployable vehicle retention means movable disposed therein. To enable greater portability, the base may be provided in sections, which are then attached together on site. The vehicle retention means, such as netting, flexible polymer or fabric panels, etc., is attached to the base via quickly raisable retention means supports. These retention means supports may be a rigid or flexible column, spring, etc. In addition to retention means supports, which entrap the vehicle, lockable rollers are employed in the base, which may be unlocked and therefore allowed to rotate freely, preventing the vehicles tires from gripping a surface. \\n     Moreover, exit prevention plates are movably disposed on the base, which prevent the vehicles tires from rolling forward or backward, thereby preventing exit of the vehicle from the system. And, as an optional embodiment, tire puncturing devices, such as deployable, tire piercing spikes, may be disposed on or embedded in the base and/or rollers, so as to allow an operator to deploy the spikes and puncture the tires of the intended vehicle. \\n     As mentioned above, the system is highly portable, as the base may be loaded on a flatbed truck and simply laid on any desired surface. Thus, importantly, no extensive installation procedures are needed. Further, the system may be directly controlled via a wired or direct mechanical actuation means or, alternatively, a user may wirelessly control the deployment of the vehicle retention means via a wireless operator control unit (OCU) in wireless communication with the system. Therefore, an operator may stay at a safe distance from the system, while still maintaining a secure perimeter using the system of the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n         FIG. 1  is a perspective top view of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention, illustrating the orientation of the components of the system after deployment of the vehicle retention means and raising of the first and second exit prevention plates, wherein the vehicle retention means is flexible netting. \\n         FIG. 2  is a side view of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention, illustrating a vehicle being restrained by the system. \\n         FIG. 3  is a perspective top view of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention in a non-deployed state, i.e., wherein the vehicle retention means, exit prevention plates, and tire puncturing devices have not been raised relative to the base. In this state, vehicles may pass over the base without incident. \\n         FIG. 4  is a perspective bottom view, partially cut away, of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention, illustrating the friction generating means that may be removably disposed on the bottom surface of the base, so as to increase friction between the base and surface upon which it rests, as well as the locking means utilized to lock the rollers in place. \\n         FIG. 5  is a perspective top view of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention, in which the vehicle retention means is comprised of a polymeric material having perforations therethrough. \\n         FIG. 6  is perspective top view of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention, in which the vehicle retention means is comprised of a flexible panel of polymeric, plastic or rubber material. \\n         FIG. 7  is a perspective view of the operator control unit (OCU) by which an operator may wirelessly control the system of the present invention, via communication with the actuation control interface means. \\n         FIG. 8  is a partial side view, cut away, of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention, illustrating the connectivity of the vehicle retention means with the first exit prevention plate, the connectivity of the first exit prevention plate with the ratcheted slide rails, the locking means operable to prevent rotation of the rollers, the tire puncturing devices integrated into the rollers, and the communication of the OCU (shown in  FIG. 7 ) with the pressure sensor plate. \\n         FIG. 9  is a top perspective view of the vehicle restraint system of the present invention, illustrating the multi-sectional embodiment of the base. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \\n     As illustrated in  FIG. 1 , the present invention provides a vehicle restraint system  1  comprised, generally of a base  3 , retention means supports  17  movably attached to the base at the bottom portion  19  of the supports  17 , and vehicle retention means  23  attached to the supports  17  and base  3 . In particular, a base  3  is provided, having a top surface  5 , a bottom surface  7  (as illustrated in  FIG. 4 ), a first end  9 , a second end  11 , opposing sides  13 , and slots  15  formed therein. The base  3  is preferably simply laid upon the installation surface, such as a roadway, and requires no further mounting procedures. To increase portability, as illustrated in  FIG. 9 , the base  3  may be formed in a plurality of sections  3   a ,  3   b ,  3   c , which are then attached together via conventional means on site. Further, to ease handling, handles  4  may be attached to or formed integrally therewith. \\n     The retention means supports  17 , each having a bottom portion  19  and a top portion  21 , are disposed in or adjacent to each of the slots  15 , adjacent the second end  11  of the base  3 . The supports  17  are disposed in movable engagement with the base  3 , so as to allow the supports  17  to be retracted into the base  3 , below the top surface  5  thereof. For example, the supports  17  may be attached via a simple hinge mechanism, or alternatively be comprised of one or more springs stored within the base in a compressed manner which, upon actuation, are freed to spring upwards and project above the top surface  5  of the base  3 . \\n     The retention means supports  17  may be comprised of a rigid material, so as to retain their integrity during vehicle impact, as illustrated in  FIG. 2 . Alternatively, in a preferred embodiment, the supports  17  are comprised of one or more semi-rigid or flexible materials, such as plastics, polymers, rubbers, or a combination thereof, such that the retention means supports  17  may support the retention means  23  in an elevated manner, but flex when a vehicle impacts with the vehicle retention means  23 . \\n     As illustrated in  FIGS. 1 and 2 , the vehicle retention means  23  is comprised of one or more of a cable, mesh, or netting. Such cable, mesh, or netting is formed of a plastic or polymer, Kevlar, nylon, a metal, or a combination of same. In an alternative embodiment, as illustrated in  FIGS. 5 and 6 , the vehicle retention means  23  may be formed of a perforated or solid panel of material, such as a flexible plastic or polymer sheet. In either event, preferably, the vehicle retention means  23  is formed of a material which is flexible in nature, but which is high breaking/tearing strength. Importantly, the material is to be chosen such that it can withstand the vehicle impact, while retaining the vehicle until the inertia thereof is dissipated by the friction between the base and the surface upon which is rests. \\n     An actuation means (now shown) is provided in communication with the retention means supports  17 , such that the actuation means are capable of controlling movement of the retention means supports relative to the base. The actuation means may be one or more of a mechanical actuation device, an electromechanical device, a propellant-charged device, or a combination of same. Importantly, the actuation means is capable of quickly propelling the supports  17  upwards relative to the base, so as to retain the vehicle retention means  23  in an orientation capable of retaining a vehicle, as illustrated in  FIG. 2 . \\n     The actuation means may be actuated by a user via an actuation control interface means  47 , as illustrated in  FIG. 1 . Such interface  47  may be a simple conventional mechanical interface, wherein a user switches a switch, pulls a cord, etc., so as to actuate the actuation means. Alternatively, the interface means  47  may be comprised of a simply logic device or computer processor in communication with the actuation means, and a wireless communication means, so as to allow a user to control the actuation means  25  remotely, via a wireless capable operator control unit  35 , as illustrated in  FIG. 7 . Such remote wireless capability enables users of the system  1  to maintain a safe operating distance from the system  1 , providing a high degree of operational safety. \\n     As illustrated in  FIGS. 1 ,  3 ,  5 ,  6 ,  8  and  9 , in an preferred embodiment, a plurality of rollers  27  are disposed on or in the base, level with or slightly below the top surface  5  of the base  3 , and in rotatable connection therewith. Although there is no limitation as to where the rollers  27  are disposed, preferably, the rollers  27  are disposed adjacent the first end  9  and second end  11  of the base  3 , such that the tires of passing vehicles may be in alignment therewith. As illustrated in  FIG. 8 , to prevent rolling of the rollers  27  during operation, locking means  29  may be disposed in communication with the rollers  27 . \\n     By locking the rollers  27 , vehicle may pass unimpeded over the base  3 . However, when a threatening vehicle is detected, and the supports  17  raised, the locking means  29  may be unlocked into a rollable state either automatically through connection with the actuation means  25 , supports  17 , vehicle retention means  23 , or via a command received directly or indirectly from the OCU  35 . In this rollable state, vehicle tires spin freely without traction when resting upon the rollers, thereby impeding movement of the vehicle relative to the base  3 . As a further means of preventing a vehicle from moving relative to the base  3 , as illustrated in  FIGS. 1 and 2 , a first exit prevention plate  31  is provided in hinged connection with the base  3  adjacent the first end  9  thereof. As illustrated in  FIG. 3 , during normal operation wherein vehicle are permitted to freely pass over the system  1 , the first exit prevention plate  31  is retracted into a downward orientation, so as to be flush with the top surface  5  of the base  3 . However, as illustrated in  FIG. 2 , when a threat is detected, the first exit prevention plate  31  may be raised relative to the top surface of the base  3 , thereby preventing or resisting exit of a vehicle  41  from the system  1  by obstruction of the tires thereof. \\n     In a preferred embodiment, as illustrated  FIG. 8 , the first exit prevention plate  31  may be in mechanical communication with the vehicle retention means  23 , such that when the retention means supports  17  are actuated, resulting in the raising of the vehicle retention means  23  relative to the base  3 , and the vehicle impacts with the retention means  23 , the vehicle retention means exert a forward pulling force on the first exit prevention plate  31 . This forward pulling force is translated via a pulley or geared system into a force operable to elevate the plate  31  into an obstructive position. \\n     In a further preferred embodiment, as illustrated in  FIGS. 2 and 8 , the first exit prevention plate  31  is in slidable communication with the base  3  via one or more ratcheted slide rails  43 . As illustrated in operation in  FIG. 2 , by providing ratchets integral with, on or in communication with the sliding rails, the plate  31  is permitting to slide forward, from adjacent the first end  9  of the base towards the second end  11 , until the plate  31  rests against the tires of vehicle  41 . However, the one-way ratchets prevent the plate  31  from moving back towards the first end  9 , thereby preventing the vehicle from backing up and off of the base  3 . \\n     Alternatively, the first exit prevention plate  31  may be disposed in communication with the actuation means, such that the actuation means is operable to raise the first exit prevention plate relative to the base. In such an alternative embodiment, the plate  31  is in communication with actuation means is operable to directly raise the plate  31 . However, a second actuation means, such as an electric, hydraulic or pneumatic motor, may be provided solely for the raising and lowering of the plate  31 . Such second actuation means is preferably in communication with the interface means  47  and/or the OCU  35 . \\n     In addition to the first exit prevention plate  31 , as illustrated in  FIGS. 1 and 3 , a second exit prevention plate  33  is provided in hinged connection with the base  3  adjacent the second end  11  thereof. Like the first exit prevention plate  31 , this second exit prevention plate  33  may be raised relative to the top surface of the base, thereby preventing or resisting exit of a vehicle from the system adjacent the second end  11  thereof. Further, like the first exit prevention plate  31 , the second exit prevention plate  33  may be in communication with the retention means supports, the actuation means, the interface means  47 , and/or the OCU  35 , etc., so as to raise same automatically or upon command. \\n     In an optional embodiment, as illustrated in  FIGS. 1 ,  3  and  8 , a pressure sensor  45  may be disposed at or adjacent to the first end  9  of the base  3 , and in communication with the actuation means and/or the actuation control interface means  47 . In particular, the pressure sensor  45  may be disposed so as to sense contact of a vehicle with the base  3 . When sensing contact of a vehicle, the pressure sensor  45  may be configured to cause the supports  17  to be raised, the exit prevention plates  31 ,  33  to be locked in a timed fashion, the rollers  27  to be unlocked, etc. Further, the pressure sensor may be directly activated/deactivated by a user, or remotely activated/deactivated via the OCU  35 , as illustrated in  FIG. 8 . \\n     As mentioned above, the system  1  may be simply laid upon the desired surface, such as roadway, checkpoint, building entrance, military base entrance, etc., and thus desirably requires no technical installation procedures. When a threatening vehicle is retained in the retention means  23 , as illustrated in  FIG. 2 , the kinetic energy/inertia of the vehicle is dissipated by frictional interaction of the base  3  with the surface upon which is rests. Therefore, the base  3  is permitted to slide relative to the ground, so as to stop the vehicle  41  in a controlled manner. In order to increase the friction between the base  3  and the support surface, as illustrated in  FIG. 4 , one or more friction generating structures  37  may be disposed on or integral with the bottom surface  7  of the base  3 . These friction generating structures  37  may be comprised of metal, polymer, rubber, or a combination thereof, but any material that is suitable to create friction between the surface upon which the system  1  shall be placed is acceptable. Preferably, the friction generating structures  37  are removably connected to the base, so as to allow replacement thereof when they are worn down through use, or are to be replaced with another device structure/material more suitable to the intended application. \\n     As illustrated in  FIG. 8 , in a preferred embodiment, a further vehicle impediment is provided, namely tire puncturing devices  55 . In particular, one or more tire-puncturing devices  55  may movably disposed on or within the base  3  and/or rollers  27 , and in communication with one or more of the actuation means, pressure sensor  45 , interface means  47 , and OCU  35 . These tire-puncturing devices, when deployed into an orientation protruding above the top surface  5  of the base  3 , are capable of puncturing a tire of a vehicle upon impact therewith. These tire-puncturing devices  55  may take many forms, but preferably are one or more of mechanically-deployed spikes, hydraulically deployed spikes, pneumatically-deployed spikes, or pyrotechnically deployed spikes. \\n     Although specific embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed herein, those having ordinary skill in the art will understand that changes can be made to the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

No. 12/197,152, filed Aug. 22, 2008, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/968,019, filed Aug. 24, 2007. The contents of these applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. \\n     \\n    \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n       [0002]    1. Field of the Invention \\n         [0003]    This invention relates to covers for heaters, such as stand-type gas or electric heaters, and methods of using the same. The heater can be, for example, a movable or fixed patio heater or table-top heater. \\n         [0004]    2. Description of Related Art \\n         [0005]    Typical tower heaters, such as those used for outdoor and patio use, have an appearance that is considered \\u201cindustrial\\u201d and sterile by many. Some newer designs for tower heaters obstruct the typical \\u201cindustrial\\u201d design, for example, providing the tower heater with the configuration of a palm tree, or other design. These alternate designs are permanently fixed to the heater. However, it is often desired to change the design of the heater without having to have separate heaters for each design or without having to incur the expense to purchase a new standup heater to change the design. \\n         [0006]    Tower heaters (e.g., patio heaters) are often used in public, residential, and commercial locales. For example, tower heaters are often located in outdoor seating areas at restaurants, in plazas, and outdoor malls; or by event planners or rental companies for functions or parties. These locations make the heaters optimum sites for advertising. However, the towers are often too thin and the heat shields of the heaters are too steep of an angle and its surface too hot to reasonably display advertising. The base is also well below eye level, so posting advertising on the base would be generally out of sight. \\n         [0007]    Therefore, replaceable and/or removable outer configuration for tower heaters is desired. Furthermore, a configuration of a heater and accompanying method for reasonably attaching a display to a tower heater is desired. \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n       [0008]    A device for camouflaging the mechanical structure of a tower (e.g., patio, outdoor) heater is disclosed. The device can be a cover or shell. The cover can have an assembly of, for example, two to four panels or \\u201cskins\\u201d or cover sections. The cover sections can be rigid or flexible. The cover sections can be rotatably attached to each other, for example via one or more rotatable hinges. The cover sections can be attached to the underlying mechanical structure of the tower heater in a \\u201cclamshell\\u201d fashion. \\n         [0009]    The cover can be constructed from one or more elements that extend longitudinally along the entire cover, or horizontally with the split occurring somewhere around the base and tower, or the cover can be made from a body cover and/or separate head cover. The body cover can have a tower cover and a separate base cover. The head cover can be a decorative \\u201cshade\\u201d or shield around the existing parabolic heat deflector heat shield or heater head) at the top of the heater structure. \\n         [0010]    The head cover can have a cylindrical or a conical, square, polygonal, elliptical, hemispherical configuration or a partial configuration of any of the aforementioned. configurations, or a combination of any of the configurations thereof. If the head cover has a conical or partial conical configuration, the angle of the cone with respect to the longitudinal axis of the heater can be from about 0\\u00b0 to about 45\\u00b0+/\\u2212 in either direction, more narrowly from about 0\\u00b0 to about 25\\u00b0 in either direction. \\n         [0011]    One or more displays can be attached to the heater head, tower, body, base, head cover, tower cover, base cover, body cover, or combinations thereof. The displays can have a flat or curved surface. The displays can form an angle with the longitudinal axis of the heater from about 0\\u00b0 to about 45\\u00b0+/\\u2212 in either direction, more narrowly from about 0\\u00b0 to about 25\\u00b0 in either direction. \\n         [0012]    The cover can be made from one or more rigid or semi rigid materials, for example thermoplastics (e.g., Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP)), polycarbonates, or silicon of vinyl-base materials or EVA copolymers which may, for example, be blow, injection, or rotational molded, fiberglass reinforced polymers (\\u201cFRP\\u201d or fiberglass), resins, stamped or spun sheet metal, urethane over a formed metal structure, heat resistant fabrics stretched around a metal frame, or combinations thereof in smooth or textured finish. The material can be opaque, translucent or transparent. The cover can be made from materials that can be lightweight, suited for outdoor use, long lasting, and have durable finish in multiple colors. The cover can be made by being molded, for example roto-molded. \\n         [0013]    The cover sections can be attached to and detached from each other with mechanical hardware, such as one or more fasteners including quick release fasteners  70 , one or more piece of hook and loop tape (e.g., Velcro) one or more piece of interlocking stem and head. tape (e.g., Dual Lock from 3M Corporation of Minneapolis, Minn.), magnets, latches, clips, ties, hooks, locking pins, the ports and flanges to which they are to attach, and combinations thereof, for example applied on overlapping flanges (e.g., tongue-and-groove, guide-pins, grooves) or into ports of adjacent cover sections. The fasteners  70  can be locked, hooked, pressed, snapped or otherwise joined together into place. \\n         [0014]    The cover sections can be hinged together, for example in a clamshell fashion. \\n         [0015]    The cover sections can have horizontal seams. The horizontal seams can divide the cover sections into two or more section that can telescope or separate when moved relative to each other in a vertical direction. For example, a lower section can slide upwards, and may temporarily come to rest on the under structure of the patio heater column to gain access, for example, to the propane tank area, for example to service the propane tank area or replace the propane tank. The cover sections can be simply and repeatedly assembled, disassembled, and easily transported between locations, or stored by nesting the cover sections together. \\n         [0016]    The covers can have fluting or grooves, textures, appliques, self-adhesive tape, and combinations thereof. For example, these features (e.g., fluting/grooves, textures, decorative rings, etc.) can hide joints between the cover sections while providing aesthetic design alternatives. \\n         [0017]    The head cover sections can be punctured, louvered, folded, made of metal mesh, or otherwise treated, for example to dissipate and/or collect and/or direct heat and/or to provide alternate aesthetics. \\n         [0018]    The head cover sections can be attached to and detached from the tower, head and base of the heater. The head cover sections can have or be attached to straps or spokes. For example, two to four or three to six straps or spokes can radially extend from the center of the heater. The straps or spokes can attach to the cover section (e.g., the head cover or the body cover). Mechanical quick-release fasteners  70  can attach the cover sections to the heater head or body (e.g., tower or base). The fasteners  70  can thermally insulate the cover sections from the heater head or body. The thermal insulators can be spacers and/or a layer of thermal insulating material. \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n         [0019]      FIG. 1  illustrates a

The mobile ferromagnetic element is actuated by means of application of a force generated by distributing suitable currents to the electromagnets, such that the element is made to abut alternately one or the other of the electromagnets themselves, so as to move the corresponding valve between the positions of closure and maximum opening, according to required times and paths. By this means, it is possible to actuate the valves according to optimum raising conditions in all operative conditions of the engine, thus improving substantially the overall performance.  \\n           [0004]    However, in the aforementioned electromagnetic actuators, a serious problem can arise when particularly high currents are distributed. In fact, as a result of, for example, a temporary or permanent malfunctioning, the currents which are supplied to the actuators can assume values which are substantially higher than those planned for the normal functioning conditions. In these cases, the power absorbed can cause sudden overheating of the windings of the electromagnets, and damage them in a few milliseconds in a manner which can even be irreparable. In addition, breakage of the windings makes it impossible to control opening and closure of the valves, and consequently makes the propulsion unit unusable until maintenance intervention is carried out, to replace the faulty actuator(s). In addition, if the cause of the overheating is not correctly determined and eliminated, a high risk of further faults persists.  \\n         SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n         [0005]    The object of the present invention is to provide a method for protection against overheating, which makes it possible to overcome the disadvantages described, and which, in particular, makes it possible to reduce the risk of breakage of the windings of the electromagnets.  \\n           [0006]    According to the present invention, a method is provided for protection against overheating of electromagnetic actuators for actuation of intake and exhaust valves in internal-combustion engines, in which an actuator of an engine is connected to a respective intake or exhaust valve, and comprises a mobile unit which is actuated magnetically, in order to control the movement of the said valve, and a first and a second electromagnet, which are disposed on opposite sides of the said mobile unit; the said actuator also being connected to a control unit, via piloting means which supply at least one current, and to current-measuring means; the said current-measuring means supplying to the said control unit measured values of the said at least one current;  \\n           [0007]    the method being characterised in that it comprises the steps of:  \\n           [0008]    a) estimating for each of the said first and second electromagnets, a temperature value which is updated on the basis of a present temperature value and of the said measured values of the said at least one current;  \\n           [0009]    b) checking whether the said updated temperature value is lower than a first threshold; and  \\n           [0010]    c) implementing protective action, if the updated temperature value is higher than the said first threshold. \\n       \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       [0011]    In order to assist understanding of the invention, an embodiment is now described, purely by way of non-limiting example, and with reference to the attached drawings, in which:  \\n         [0012]    [0012]FIG. 1 is a lateral elevated view, partially in cross-section, of an electromagnetic actuator, and of the corresponding intake or exhaust valve;  \\n         [0013]    [0013]FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram relating to the method for control according to the present invention; and  \\n         [0014]    [0014]FIG. 3 is a flow chart relating to the method for control according to the present invention. \\n     \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0015]    With reference to FIG. 1, an electromagnetic actuator  1  is connected to an intake or exhaust valve  2  of an internal combustion engine, which for the sake of convenience is not shown. The actuator  1  comprises a small oscillating arm  3  made of ferromagnetic material, which has a first end pivoted on a fixed support  4 , such as to be able to oscillate around an axis A of rotation, which is horizontal and is perpendicular to a longitudinal axis B of the valve  2 . In addition, a second end  5  of the small oscillating arm  3  co-operates such as to abut an upper end of the valve  2 , so as to impart to the latter reciprocal motion in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis B.  \\n         [0016]    The actuator  1  comprises a first and a second electromagnet  6   a,    6   b  for opening, which are disposed on opposite sides of the body of the small oscillating arm  3 , such as to be able to act by command, in sequence or simultaneously, to exert a net force F on the small oscillating arm  3 , in order to make it rotate around the axis A of rotation.  \\n         [0017]    In addition, a first and a second resilient element, for example a spring and a torsion bar, which for the sake of convenience are not shown, act such as to maintain the small oscillating arm  3  in a position of rest, in which it is equidistant from the polar heads respectively of the first and second electromagnets  6   a,    6   b.    \\n         [0018]    As shown in FIG. 2, in an internal combustion engine  20 , a system  10  for control of actuators  1 , of the type described in FIG. 1, comprises a control unit  11 , a piloting circuit  12 , a current-measuring circuit  13 , and a position sensor  14 .  \\n         [0019]    The control unit  11  is connected to the piloting circuit  12 , to which, for each actuator  1  present, it supplies a first and a second objective value I 01 , I 02  of currents which must be distributed. For the sake of simplicity, reference will be made hereinafter to a single actuator  1 : this should not be considered as a limiting factor, since all the actuators  1  present can be controlled in a similar manner. The piloting circuit  12  has a first and a second output connected respectively to the first and the second electromagnets  6   a,    6   b  of the actuator  1 , in order to supply a first and a second current I 1 , I 2 , with values which are equivalent respectively to the first and the second objective values I 01 , I 02 .  \\n         [0020]    The current-measuring circuit  13  has a first and a second input, which are connected respectively to the first and the second outputs of the piloting circuit  12 , and it is also connected to the control unit  11 . In particular, the current-measuring circuit  13  supplies to the control unit  11  respective measured values I M1 , I M2  of the first and second currents I 1 , I 2 .  \\n         [0021]    The position sensor  14 , which has an output connected to the control unit  11 , supplies to the control unit  11  itself a measurement of a real position Z of the valve  2 .  \\n         [0022]    The system  10  uses a method for control of electromagnetic actuators, for example as described in Italian patent application no. B099A000594 of Nov. 5, 1999, filed in the name of the applicant.  \\n         [0023]    This patent application relates to control of an electromagnetic actuator, substantially of the type of the actuator  1  described in FIG. 1, to which reference will continue to be made. According to the method described in the aforementioned application, a check with feedback is carried out on the real position Z and on a real speed V of the valve  2 , using as a checking variable the net force F applied by means of the first and second electromagnets  6   a,    6   b,  to the small oscillating arm  3  which actuates the valve  2  itself. For this purpose, by means of a model which is based on a dynamic system, there is calculation of an objective force F o  to be exerted on the small oscillating arm, in accordance with the real position Z, the real speed V, a reference position Z R  and a reference speed V R  of the valve. In particular, the dynamic system is described by means of the following matrix equation:  \\n               [           Z   .               V   .           ]     =         [         0       1             K   /   M           B   /   M           ]     \\ue89e     \\u2003     [         Z           V         ]     +       [         0             1   /   M           ]     \\ue89e   F               (   2   )                               \\n \\n         [0024]    in which Z and V are the temporal derivatives respectively of the real position Z and the real speed V; F is the net force exerted on the small oscillating arm  3 ; K is a resilient constant, B is a viscous constant, and M is a total equivalent mass of the valve  2  and the small oscillating arm  3 . In particular, the net force F and the real position Z represent respectively an input and an output of the dynamic system.  \\n         [0025]    In addition, the objective force value F c  is calculated according to the equation:  \\n           F   o =( N   1   Z   R   +N   2   V   R )\\u2212( K   1   Z+K   2   V )\\u2003\\u2003(3)  \\n         [0026]    in which N 1 , N 2 , K 1  and K 2  are gains which can be calculated by applying well-known robust control techniques to the dynamic system represented by the equation (2).  \\n         [0027]    Subsequently, the control unit  11  calculates the objective values I 01 , I 02  of the currents I 1 , I 2  to be distributed to the electromagnets  6   a,    6   b,  in order for the net force F exerted on the small oscillating arm  3  to be equivalent to the objective force value F o .  \\n         [0028]    In addition, the control unit  11  implements the method according to the present invention, for protection against overheating, which will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 3. In addition, for the sake of simplicity, reference will be made to a single electromagnet of the actuator  1 , for example the first electromagnet  6   a,  since the method can be applied in a manner which is altogether similar, also to the second electromagnet  6   b.    \\n         [0029]    A malfunctioning signal ERR inside the control unit 11 is initially set to a first logic value, for example a logic value \\u201cFALSE\\u201d, which is indicative of a normal functioning condition of the actuator  1  (block  100 ).  \\n         [0030]    Subsequently, calculation is carried out of the energy E I  which is dissipated in the windings of the first electromagnet  6   a,  in a checking interval \\u03c4 1 , which has a pre-determined duration, and for example is equivalent to 50 ms (block  110 ). In detail, the measured value I M1  of the first current I 1  is sampled, for example with a sampling period \\u03c4 2  which is equivalent to 50 \\u03bcs, throughout the duration of the checking interval \\u03c4 1 , such as to obtain a number N of sampled values I D1 , I D2 , . . . , I DN . The energy E I  dissipated is calculated on the basis of the equation:  \\n               E   I     =       \\u2211     I   =   1     N     \\ue89e     \\u2003     \\ue89e       RI   DI   2     \\ue89e     \\u03c4   2                 (   1   )                               \\n \\n         [0031]    in which R is an equivalent series resistance of the windings of the first electromagnet  1 , the value of which can be determined experimentally.  \\n         [0032]    Subsequently, estimation is carried out of an updated temperature value T K+1  of the windings of the first electromagnet  6   a,  in accordance with a present temperature value T K  and with the energy dissipated E I  (block  120 ). In particular, the updated temperature value T K+1  is calculated according to the equation:  \\n           T   K+1 =(1 \\u2212A   1   \\u2212   A   2 \\u03c4 1 ) T   K   +A   1 \\u03c4 1   E   I \\u2003\\u2003(2)  \\n         [0033]    which can be obtained from the following thermal balancing equation:  \\n                   T     K   +   1       -     T   K         \\u03c4   1       =       A   1     \\ue8a0     (       E   I     -       A   2     \\ue89e     T   K         )               (   3   )                               \\n \\n         [0034]    In the equations (2) and (3), A 1  and A 2  are a first and a second coefficient, which take into account the thermal capacity of the windings of the first electromagnet  6   a,  and conductive and convective thermal exchange factors. The first and the second coefficients A 1 , A 2  depend on the structural characteristics of the actuator  1  (geometry and materials), are pre-determined, and can be established experimentally.  \\n         [0035]    After the updated temperature value T K  has been estimated, a test is carried out in order to check whether the malfunctioning signal ERR is at the first logic value (\\u201cFALSE\\u201d, block  130 ).  \\n         [0036]    If this is the case (YES output from block  130 ), a second test is carried out in order to verify that the updated temperature value T K+1  is lower than a first threshold T S1  (block  140 ). If this condition is met (YES output from block  140 ), there is a return to execution of calculation of the energy E I  dissipated in the windings of the first electromagnet  6   a  in the checking interval \\u03c4 1  (block  110 ). Otherwise (NO output from block  140 ), the malfunctioning signal ERR is set to a second logic value, indicative of a condition of overheating (for example a logic value \\u201cTRUE\\u201d, block  150 ). In addition, protection intervention is implemented (block  160 ), which consists for example of disabling the actuator  1 , and stopping the engine  20  temporarily, such as to prevent further dangerous heating of the windings of the first electromagnet  6   a.  However, the control unit  11  can also be supplied with power when the engine  20  is not running, and is thus able to continue execution of the protection process, and to return to execution of calculation of the energy E I  dissipated in the windings of the first electromagnet  6   a  (block  110 ).  \\n         [0037]    If the malfunctioning signal ERR is at the second logic value (\\u201cTRUE\\u201d, NO output from block  130 ), a further test is carried out in order to check that the updated temperature value T K+1  is lower than a second threshold T S2 , which is lower than the first threshold T S1  (block  170 ). If this is the case (YES output from block  170 ), the protection intervention is suspended (block  75 ), and the malfunctioning signal ERR is set once again to the first logic value (\\u201cFALSE\\u201d, block  180 ), such as to re-enable use of the actuator  1 , and starting of the engine  20 . If, on the other hand, the updated temperature value T K+1  is higher than the second threshold T S2  (NO output from block  170 ), the protection intervention is continued (block  190 ). Subsequently, there is return to execution of calculation of the energy E I  dissipated in the windings of the first electromagnet  6   a  (block  110 ).  \\n         [0038]    As previously stated, the method for protection is applied in each actuator  1 , both for the first electromagnet  6   a,  and for the second electromagnet  6   b.  By this means, the temperatures of all the windings are estimated and verified at each checking interval \\u03c4 1 , i.e. approximately every 50 ms.  \\n         [0039]    The advantages of the present invention are apparent from the foregoing description.  \\n         [0040]    Firstly, the risk of breakages of the windings of the electromagnets present in the actuators is substantially reduced. Since in fact the checking interval \\u03c4 1  has a short duration, updating of the estimates of the temperatures of the windings is carried out with a high frequency. Consequently, any overheating is detected in good time, and the immediate suspension of distribution of currents prevents the actuators from being damaged.  \\n         [0041]    In addition, the engine can be restarted as soon as the temperature of the overheated windings returns within safety limits, i.e. below the second threshold T S2 . This is particularly advantageous if the overheating can be attributed to causes which are not permanent, and do not necessarily require maintenance intervention.  \\n         [0042]    Finally, it is apparent that modifications and variants can be made to the method described, without departing from the context of the present invention.  \\n         [0043]    In particular, it is possible to carry out various protection interventions on the basis of indication of a condition of overheating in one of the actuators  1  present (blocks  160 ,  190 ). For example, the control unit  11  can disable the actuator  1  which is not functioning correctly, and can exclude only the corresponding cylinder, By this means, there is therefore prevention of damage to the overheated windings, and the further advantage is obtained of not stopping the propulsion unit immediately, and of making it operate temporarily in emergency conditions.\",\n          \"FIELD OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0001]     The present invention relates generally to power transfer systems operable for controlling the distribution of drive torque between a pair of rotary shafts and, more particularly, to clutch control systems operable to efficiently convert electrical energy to mechanical potential energy for subsequent actuation of a clutch.  \\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0002]     In view of increased consumer demand for four-wheel drive vehicles, a plethora of power transfer systems are currently being utilized in vehicular driveline applications for selectively directing power (i.e., drive torque) to the non-driven wheels of the vehicle. In many power transfer systems, a part-time transfer case is incorporated into the driveline and is normally operable in a two-wheel drive mode for delivering drive torque to the driven wheels. A mechanical mode shift mechanism can be selectively actuated by the vehicle operator for rigidly coupling the non-driven wheel to the driven wheels in order to establish a part-time four-wheel drive -mode. As will be appreciated, a motor vehicle equipped with a part-time transfer case offers the vehicle operator the option of selectively shifting between the two-wheel drive mode during normal road conditions and the part-time four-wheel drive mode for operation under adverse road conditions.  \\n         [0003]     Alternatively, it is known to use \\u201con-demand\\u201d power transfer systems for automatically directing power to the non-driven wheels, without any input or action on the part of the vehicle operator, when traction is lost at the driven wheels. Modernly, it is known to incorporate the on-demand feature into a transfer case by replacing the mechanically-actuated mode shift mechanism with a clutch assembly that is interactively associated with an electronic control system and a sensor arrangement. During normal road conditions, the clutch assembly is maintained in a non-actuated condition such that the drive torque is only delivered to the driven wheels. However, when the sensors detect a low traction condition at the driven wheels, the clutch assembly is automatically actuated to deliver drive torque \\u201con-demand\\u201d to the non-driven wheels. Moreover, the amount of drive torque transferred through the clutch assembly to the normally non-driven wheels can be varied as a function of specific vehicle dynamics, as detected by the sensor arrangement.  \\n         [0004]     Conventional clutch assemblies typically include a clutch pack operably connected between a drive member and a driven member. A power-operated actuator controls engagement of the clutch pack. Specifically, torque is transferred from the drive member to the driven member by actuating the power-operated actuator. The power-operated actuator displaces an apply plate which acts on the clutch pack and increases the frictional engagement between the interleaved plates.  \\n         [0005]     A variety of power-operated actuators have been used in the art. Exemplary embodiments include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,024 wherein a ball-ramp arrangement is used to displace the apply plate when a current is provided to an induction motor. Another example disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,060, assigned to the assignee of the present application, includes a linear actuator that pivots a lever arm to regulate the frictional forces applied to the clutch pack. These types of systems are often equipped with motors that may require peak electrical currents greater than optimally desired to operate the clutch actuators. While the above actuator devices may perform adequately for their intended purpose, a need exists for an improved clutch actuation system that requires a relatively low, minimally fluctuating supply of electrical power for operation.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0006]     A power transmission device includes a rotary input member receiving drive torque from a source of torque, a rotary output member for providing drive torque to an output device and a torque transfer mechanism for transferring drive torque between the input member and the output member. The torque transfer mechanism includes a friction clutch assembly operably disposed between the input member and the output member and a hydraulic clutch actuation system operable for applying a clutch engagement force to the friction clutch assembly. The hydraulic clutch actuation system includes an electric motor drivingly coupled to the hydraulic actuator. The hydraulic actuator includes a first piston biasedly engaged by a spring wherein the first piston is slidably positioned within a housing and operable to supply pressurized fluid to a second piston. Supply of pressurized fluid to the second piston provides the clutch engagement force. \\n     \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       [0007]     The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given below, the appended claims, and the accompanying drawings in which:  \\n         [0008]      FIG. 1  is a schematic representation of an exemplary four-wheel drive vehicle having the clutch control systems of the present invention incorporated therein;  \\n         [0009]      FIG. 2  is a schematic representation of a first embodiment clutch actuation system;  \\n         [0010]      FIG. 3  is a schematic representation of an alternate embodiment clutch actuation system; and  \\n         [0011]      FIG. 4  is a schematic representation of an alternate embodiment clutch actuation system. \\n     \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT  \\n       [0012]     In general, the present invention is directed to a power transfer system which is operably installed between the driven and non-driven wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle. In operation, the amount of drive torque transferred to the non-driven wheels is controllably regulated in accordance with various system and driver-initiated inputs for optimizing the tractive characteristics of the vehicle. In addition, the power transfer system may also include a mode select mechanism for permitting a vehicle operator to select between a two-drive wheel mode, a part-time four-wheel drive mode, and an \\u201con-demand\\u201d drive mode. The power transfer system of the present invention includes a clutch control system for converting electrical energy to mechanical potential energy to alleviate exceedingly high peak electrical current requirements that may occur during vehicle operation.  \\n         [0013]     Referring to  FIG. 1  of the drawings, a drivetrain for a four-wheel drive vehicle is schematically shown interactively associated with a power transfer system  10 . The motor vehicle drivetrain has a pair of front wheels  12  and rear wheels  14  both drivable from a source of power, such as an engine  16 , through a transmission  18  which may be of either the manual or automatic type. In the particular embodiment shown, the drivetrain is a rear wheel drive system which incorporates a transfer case  20  operable to receive drive torque from engine  16  and transmission  18  for normally driving rear wheels  14  (i.e., the \\u201cdriven\\u201d wheels) in a two-wheel drive mode of operation. Front wheels  12  and rear wheels  14  are shown connected at opposite ends of front and rear axle assemblies  22  and  24 , respectively. As is known, a rear differential  26  is interconnected between rear axle assembly  24  and one end of a rear drive shaft  28 , the opposite end of which is interconnected to a first output shaft  30  of transfer case  20 . Similarly, front axle assembly  22  includes a front differential  32  that is coupled to one end of a front drive shaft  34 , the opposite end of which is coupled to a second output shaft  36  of transfer case  20 . It is to be understood that the specific orientation of the drivetrain is merely exemplary in nature and that the drivetrain could be reversed for normally driving front wheels  12 .  \\n         [0014]     Transfer case  20  is equipped with a torque transfer clutch  38  for selectively delivering drive torque to front wheels  12  (i.e., the- non-driven wheels) to establish a four-wheel drive mode of operation. The operating mode of transfer clutch  38  is generally controlled in response to a mode signal generated by a mode selector  40  and which is sent to a controller  42 . Controller  42  also receives input signals from one or more vehicle sensors  44  that are indicative of various operational characteristic of the vehicle.  \\n         [0015]     When the two-wheel drive mode is selected, all drive torque is delivered from first output shaft  30  to rear wheels  14  and transfer clutch  38  is maintained in a \\u201cnon-actuated\\u201d condition. When the part-time four-wheel drive mode is selected, transfer clutch  38  is fully actuated and maintained in a \\u201clock-up\\u201d condition such that second output shaft  36  is, in effect, rigidly coupled for driven rotation with first output shaft  30 . When the \\u201con-demand\\u201d drive mode is selected, controller  42  communicates with a clutch control system  200  to control the degree of actuation of transfer clutch  38  for varying the amount of drive torque directed to front wheels  12  through transfer clutch  38  as a function of the sensor input signals for providing improved tractive performance when needed. In addition, controller  42  is adapted to controllably modulate the actuated state of transfer clutch  38  as described in greater detail hereinafter. By way of example rather than limitation, the control scheme generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,060 issued Jul. 26, 1994 to Sperduti et al. and assigned to the common assignee of the present invention (the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference) can be used to control adaptive actuation of transfer clutch  38  during on-demand operation.  \\n         [0016]      FIGS. 2-4  depict various clutch control systems for storing mechanical energy and reducing the maximum required electrical current for clutch actuation. The clutch control systems discussed below are an improvement over prior systems due to their ability to reduce peak power draw and overall power consumption from the vehicle&#39;s electrical system while operating the modulating clutch. The decrease in power draw is primarily accomplished by using a relatively low amount of electrical energy over time to charge a mechanical energy storage device and releasing the energy rapidly when required. This control scheme makes it possible to reduce the size of vehicle electrical system including the wires and circuitry controlling the electrical system. Each of the clutch control systems described below provides for operating a modulating clutch or clutches. The controls for the modulating clutches utilize available vehicle information along with hydraulic system information to react to a vehicle command to provide the required torque and/or speed.  \\n         [0017]     The first exemplary embodiment clutch control system  200  is depicted in  FIG. 2 . Clutch control system  200  includes an accumulator  202  as an energy storage device. Accumulator  202  may be of the gas or spring type. Clutch control system  200  also includes a hydraulic actuator  204  in communication with accumulator  202 . Hydraulic actuator  204  is operable to provide intermittent pulses of highly pressurized fluid to accumulator  202  to store mechanical potential energy in the accumulator.  \\n         [0018]     Hydraulic actuator  204  includes a housing  206  defining a cavity  208 , an electromagnet  210  and a master piston  212  slidably positioned within cavity  208  of housing  206 . Electromagnet  210  is positioned within housing  206 . A spring  214  interconnects master piston  212  and housing  206  to biasedly urge master piston  212  toward a retracted position shown in  FIG. 2 .  \\n         [0019]     Master piston  212  includes a stem portion  216  slidably positioned within a hydraulic cavity  218  formed within housing  206 . A seal  220  sealingly engages stem portion  216  and housing  206  to allow a relatively high pressure to be generated within hydraulic cavity  218 . Master piston  212  is preferably constructed from a magnetizable material such that energization of electromagnet  210  attracts a body portion  222  of master piston  212  toward electromagnet  210 .  \\n         [0020]     Hydraulic actuator  204  may be operated as a pump by alternately supplying and disconnecting power to electromagnet  210 . When the electromagnet is powered, body portion  222  of master piston  212  is attracted toward electromagnet  210 . When body portion  222  contacts electromagnet  210 , piston  212  is in the advanced position. During this operation, stem portion  216  axially translates in an advancing direction to supply pressurized fluid to accumulator  202 . Once body portion  222  contacts electromagnet  210 , power is discontinued to the electromagnet. Spring  214  forces master piston  212  toward the retracted position shown in  FIG. 2 .  \\n         [0021]     Clutch control system  200  also includes a first pressure sensor  224  in communication with accumulator  202 . First pressure sensor  224  is operable to provide a signal indicative of the fluid pressure within accumulator  202  to a controller  225 . It should be appreciated that controller  225  may be a stand alone unit or may be incorporated as part of controller  42 . A non-returning check valve  226  is plumbed between cavity  218  and accumulator  202  to allow pressurized fluid to enter the accumulator but restrict flow from the accumulator toward the pressurized fluid source. A first control valve  228  is operable to selectively supply pressurized fluid within accumulator  202  to a clutch actuator assembly  230 . Depending on system requirements, first control valve  228  may be a variable force solenoid, a pulse width modulation control valve, a proportional flow control valve or a proportional pressure control valve. Clutch actuator assembly  230  includes a plurality of slave pistons  232  substantially circumferentially spaced apart from one another and in communication with an apply plate  234 . Apply plate  234  is axially moveable and operable to transmit a clutch engagement force to transfer clutch  38 .  \\n         [0022]     Transfer clutch  38  is a multi-plate clutch assembly that is arranged to transfer torque between first output shaft  30  and second output shaft  36 . Transfer clutch  38  includes a cylindrical drum  236  shown to be operably fixed for rotation with second output shaft  36  and having a plurality of first or outer clutch plates  238  mounted (i.e., splined) for rotation with drum  236 . A clutch hub  240  of transfer clutch  38  is fixed for rotation with first output shaft  30 . A second set of clutch plates  242 , referred to as inner clutch plates, are mounted (i.e., splined) for rotation with clutch hub  240 . Torque is transferred between first output shaft  30  and second output shaft  36  by frictionally engaging first clutch plates  238  with second clutch plates  242  with a compression force supplied by apply plate  234 .  \\n         [0023]     Slave pistons  232  are slidably engageable with apply plate  234  and transmit a force proportional to the pressure acting on each of slave pistons  232 . A second pressure sensor  244  is plumbed in communication with slave pistons  232 . Second pressure sensor  244  is operable to output a signal indicative of the fluid pressure acting on slave pistons  232 . The signal is provided to controller  225  and used as a feedback signal to control the torque generated by transfer clutch  38 . A second control valve  245  is operable to selectively supply pressurized fluid acting on slave pistons  232  to a second accumulator  243 . Second accumulator  243  contains fluid at a substantially lower pressure than accumulator  202 . Pressure acting on slave pistons  232  may be selectively released to second accumulator  223  by actuating second control valve  245 .  \\n         [0024]     An optional second non-returning check valve  246  acts as a pressure relief valve to allow fluid previously acting on slave pistons  232  to return to cavity  218 . One skilled in the art will appreciate that clutch control system  200  is a closed hydraulic system. Accordingly, fluid need not be continually supplied to clutch control system  200  once the system has been initially filled with hydraulic fluid. An account for fluid leakage may be made as will be described.  \\n         [0025]     In operation, clutch control system  200  operates to charge accumulator  202  with fluid at a relatively high pressure by operating hydraulic actuator  204  and energizing electromagnet  210  to translate stem portion  216  in an advancing direction. Electromagnet  210  generates enough force to overcome the force generated by spring  214  and pressurize fluid within cavity  218 . Pressurized fluid passes through non-returning check valve  226  and enters accumulator  202 . During the accumulator charging cycle, first control valve  228  is closed. If clutch control system  200  is not equipped with a second non-returning check valve, second control valve  245  is also maintained in the closed position to charge accumulator  202 .  \\n         [0026]     Once master piston  212  is in the advanced position, the power supply to electromagnet  210  is discontinued. Spring  214  forces master piston  212  to the retracted position. The pumping or charging sequence is continued until a desired pressure within accumulator  202  is reached as indicated by a signal output from first pressure sensor  224 . It should be appreciated that hydraulic actuator  204  may produce a maximum desired pressure while requiring minimal current from the vehicle power source.  \\n         [0027]     Once the desired pressure is stored in accumulator  202  the charging cycle is discontinued. At this time, clutch control system  200  awaits a torque demand signal. Upon receipt of a signal for torque from controller  225 , first control valve  228  is opened to supply pressurized fluid to slave pistons  232 . The signal output from second pressure sensor  244  indicates the pressure acting upon slave pistons  232  and may be correlated to torque generated by transfer clutch  38 . If a reduction in output torque from transfer clutch  38  is desired, second control valve  245  is allowed to shift to its normally open position thereby releasing pressurized fluid into low pressure accumulator  243  and reduce the pressure acting upon slave pistons  232 .  \\n         [0028]     In an alternate form, clutch control system  200  may be equipped with an alternate second control valve (not shown) that operates as a normally closed valve as opposed to the normally open configuration shown in  FIG. 2 . If second control valve  245  is a normally closed valve, leakage of fluid past first control valve  228  may cause transfer clutch  38  to be in an applied condition during vehicle inoperative times. Some Original Equipment Manufacturers may not wish this condition and specify the normally open second control valve. Furthermore, any number of the valves presently depicted may be plumbed as normally or normally closed valves to meet vehicle manufacturer requirements.  \\n         [0029]      FIG. 3  depicts an alternate embodiment clutch control system  300 . Clutch control system  300  is a closed system similar to the clutch control system previously discussed. Like elements will retain the reference numerals previously introduced. Clutch control system  300  includes an actuator  302  that functions substantially similarly to hydraulic actuator  204 . However, actuator  302  includes a first magnet  304  coupled to a master piston  305 . The first electromagnet and master piston subassembly is slidably positioned within a cavity  306  of a housing  308 . A second electromagnet  310  is also positioned within cavity  306 . Second electromagnet  310  is fixed to housing  308 . Master piston  305  includes a stem portion  312  operably acting on hydraulic fluid contained within a hydraulic cavity  314  of housing  308 . A seal  316  sealingly engages stem portion  312  and cavity  314  to maintain a closed hydraulic system.  \\n         [0030]     A gap  318  exists between first electromagnet  304  and second electromagnet  310  when master piston  305  is in the retracted position as shown in  FIG. 3 . As mentioned earlier, spring  214  urges master piston  305  toward the retracted position. When the first and second electromagnets are energized, the first electromagnet and master piston subassembly is attracted to second electromagnet  310 . During this operation, stem portion  312  forces pressurized hydraulic fluid past non-returning check valve  226  into accumulator  202 . When first electromagnet  304  contacts second electromagnet  310 , the first electromagnet master piston subassembly is in the advanced position. Power is discontinued to each of the electromagnets and spring  214  forces master piston  305  back to the retracted position once again. In this manner, actuator  302  may act as a pump to provide pressurized fluid to accumulator  202 . It should be appreciated that the remaining components of clutch control system  300  and their operation are substantially similar to the components previously described in relation to clutch control system  200 . Accordingly, a redundant description will not be provided.  \\n         [0031]      FIG. 4  depicts an alternate embodiment clutch control system  400  operable for selectively supplying an actuation force to transfer clutch  38 . Clutch control system  400  is substantially similar to clutch control system  300  previously described. For clarity, like elements will retain their previously introduced reference numerals.  \\n         [0032]     Clutch control system  400  includes an actuator  402  that functions substantially similarly to hydraulic actuators  204  and  302  previously described. However, actuator  402  includes a spring return solenoid  404  coupled to a master piston  406 . Master piston  406  is slidably positioned within a cavity  408  of a housing  410 . Solenoid  404  includes a return spring (not shown) operable to return master piston  406  to a retracted position as depicted in  FIG. 4 . Energization of solenoid  404  causes master piston  406  to translate in an advancing direction. As master piston  406  translates, pressurized fluid is supplied to accumulator  202 . At the end of the stroke of master piston  406 , power is no longer supplied to solenoid  404  and the internal return spring retracts master piston  406 . This sequence of events is repeated to pump highly pressurized fluid into accumulator  202 . Other components of clutch control system  400  function substantially similarly to those previously described.  \\n         [0033]     The foregoing discussion discloses and describes an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and claims that various changes, modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the true spirit and fair scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 70162,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"A tandem pump assembly of the type including a housing (H) defining a fluid inlet port ( 37 ) and a fluid outlet port ( 35 ), a first pump ( 11 ) disposed in the housing (H) and driven by an input shaft ( 19 ).

No. 6,540,887, filed 10/11/83, entitled &#34;Grating Arrangement For An Opening Roller For Fibers&#34;. \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates to a new and improved cleaning machine for fiber material or the like. \\n     In its more specific aspects the cleaning machine for fiber or fibrous material comprises an opening roller rotatable about an axis of rotation and provided with clothing. Arranged in the following order around the opening roller are a feed device for the fiber material, a grating composed of bars, a suction chamber and a screening member, these components or parts which are arranged around the opening roller extend over the length of the latter in the direction of the rotational axis of such opening roller. The screening member has a nose or nose member which forms part of an entry or inlet opening of a suction duct leading away from the suction chamber, and a screening wall of the screening member extends away from the nose in the rotational direction of the opening roller over a part of the roller envelope or outer surface containing or enclosing the points or tips of the clothing. \\n     From German Published Patent Application No. 1,010,878 or from German Pat. No. 1,685,571, it is known, for example, to place fiber material in rapid rotation by means of an opening roller for the purpose of cleaning the material, whereby as a result of the centrifugal forces thus produced the impurities, for example, seeds and dust particles fly out of the fiber material. These outwardly propelled impurities are then led away through a grating or grating arrangement extending over a part of the envelope or outer surface of the opening roller. \\n     A screening member with a screening sheet serves for the removal of the fiber material clinging to the clothing of the opening roller, this screening sheet extending over part of the envelope or outer surface of the opening roller at a small, constant spacing from the clothing. A nose is provided at the front end (considered with reference to the direction of rotation of the opening roller) of the divertor member or screening sheet. Fiber material freed from the clothing by the screening member passes into a suction duct through which it is transported away for further processing. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     It is a primary object of the present invention to improve upon the existing limitations and shortcomings of the prior art cleaning machines for fiber material or the like. \\n     It is another more specific object of the present invention to provide for an improved clean and effective separation of the fiber material from the clothing in relation to the known cleaning devices or machines and to avoid collecting of fibers on the nose or separating edge of the screening member, with the quantity of suction air required in the suction duct being smaller than in the known arrangements. \\n     Now, in order to implement these and still further objects of the present invention, which will become more readily apparent as the description proceeds, the cleaning machine of the present development is manifested by the features that the mutual spacing of the screening wall and clothing increases in the direction of rotation of the roller from the nose or nose member towards the rearward or rear end of the screening wall. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     The invention will be better understood and objects other than those set forth above, will become apparent when consideration is given to the following detailed description thereof. Such description makes reference to the annexed drawing wherein the single FIGURE thereof shows a cross-section of a cleaning machine constructed according to the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \\n     Describing now the single FIGURE of the drawing, it is to be understood that only enough of the details of the construction of the therein illustrated exemplary embodiment of cleaning machine have been shown as needed for those skilled in the art to readily understand the underlying principles and concepts thereof, while simplifying the illustration of such drawing. It will be seen that a feed device 11 provided with two transport rollers 11a serves for feeding of fiber or fibrous material to an opening roller 12 having an outer surface or roller envelope 12a. The opening roller 12 is provided with suitable clothing 13 which is formed of teeth 13a. The terms &#34;roller envelope&#34; or &#34;outer surface&#34; refer to the circumferential surface containing the points or tips 13b  of the teeth 13a. The opening roller 12 is rotatable about its axis of rotation 15 in the rotational sense or direction indicated by the arrow 14. A pivotable frame 16 carries bars 17 which form a grating 17a. A pivotable element or flap 18 extends over a part of the roller envelope or outer surface 12a. This roller envelope part together with the pivotable element or flap 18 defines a suction chamber 22. \\n     A screening member 19 has a screening wall 20 which also extends over part of the roller envelope or outer surface 12a. The screening member 19 has a nose or nose member 21 at its forward end considered with reference to the aforementioned direction of rotation of the opening roller 12 indicated by the arrow 14. A suction duct 23 extends away from this nose 21 and flow communicates with the suction chamber 22. The entry opening 23a of the suction duct 23 is located at the region of the nose or nose member 21. The parts 11, 17, 18 and 19, which are arranged around the opening roller 12, extend over the complete length of such opening roller 12 in the direction of the rotational axis 15. The hollow spaces between the outer surface or roller envelope 12a and the pivotable element or flap 18 and screening wall 20 are closed at both ends. \\n     During operation of the illustrated cleaning machine the fiber or fibrous material which is to be cleaned is fed to the clothing 13 by means of the transport rollers 11a.  Thus, when the opening roller 12 is rotating, such fiber material is taken up by the teeth 13a, i.e., by the clothing 13. Due to the centrifugal forces caused by the rotation of the opening roller 12, impurities such as seeds, dust particles and the like present in the fiber material are hurled outwardly and, with the co-operation of the grating bars 17, are separated from the fibers which during this stage of the cleaning operation are retained on the teeth 13a of the clothing 13. Thereafter, the fiber material separates from the clothing 13 into the suction chamber 22 as a result of the effect produced by the suction chamber 22, the suction duct 23 and the screening wall 20. The cleaned fibers carried away by the suction duct 23 thereafter pass to a suitable location for further processing. \\n     Experience has shown that the separation of the fibers from the clothing 13 is substantially improved in comparison to the currently known machines if the screening wall 20 has a form or structure according to which the mutual spacing between the screening wall 20 and the clothing 13 increases in the direction away from the nose or nose member 21 in the sense of the opening roller rotation indicated by the arrow 14. This means that in comparison with the current state of the art, a trouble-free separation of the fiber flocks is obtained with a reduced quantity of air flowing through the suction duct 23, thus resulting in a saving of energy. The screening wall 20 seems to operate as a sealing element by means of which damming-up of air is produced between the boundaries 12a and 20 defined by the outer surface 12a of the opening roller 12 and the screening wall 20. Vortices arise between these boundaries 12a and 20 by means of which a back flow of air can occur at the nose or nose member 21 in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation 14 of the opening roller 12. \\n     An additional, substantial saving of suction air is obtained with an embodiment of the invention in which a closure wall 24 is provided at the rear end 20a of the screening wall 20 considered with reference to the direction of opening roller rotation indicated by the arrow 14. This closure wall 24 extends from the end of the screening wall 20 to a location close to the roller envelope or outer surface 12a. As compared to an arrangement without a closure wall this embodiment produces a trouble-free separation of the fibers from the clothing 13 with a still further reduced quantity of air in the suction duct 23, and there is also avoided contamination of the nose or nose member 21. \\n     A further advantageous embodiment of the invention (in order to produce a diversion of the material flow which is as favorable and loss-free as possible) is obtained by the provision of a pivotable element or flap 18 which is formed as shown in the drawing. The flap or pivotable element 18 extends from the entry or inlet opening 23a of the suction duct 23 located at the region of the nose 21 opposite to the direction of rotation 14 of the opening roller 12 over a portion of the roller envelope or outer surface 12a, the mutual spacing of the latter and the pivotable element or flap 18 reducing from the entry opening 23a of the suction duct 23 towards the end 18a of the flap or pivotable element 18 spaced furthest from this entry opening 23a. At the end 18a the flap or pivotable element 18 forms a gap or opening 25 with the flap or roller envelope or outer surface 12a. The part of the pivotable element 18 defining the gap or opening 25 is arranged as close as possible to the roller envelope or outer surface 12a. \\n     This type of air entry also has an essential influence on the separation of the fiber material from the clothing 13 of the opening roller 12, since by virtue of this arrangement, on the one hand, the formed air ring around the opening roller 12 is disturbed and, on the other hand, only a portion of the necessary quantity of suction air is drawn or taken-in directly from outside the cleaning machine. The remainder of the necessary quantity of suction air is obtained from the skimmed-off air ring. \\n     Furthermore, a gap or opening 26 is present between the roller envelope or outer surface 12a and the nose or nose member 21, and furthermore a gap or opening 27 is formed between the roller envelope or outer surface 12a and the closure wall 24. \\n     It is important to maintain the width of the gap or opening 26 small. It has been found that the mentioned air ring forms about the rapidly rotating opening roll 12. This air ring opposes the centrifugal force of the fiber material clinging to the saw-toothed clothing 13. On the other hand, the narrow gap or opening 26 between the nose 21 and the roller envelope or outer surface 12a destroys this air ring. It is &#34;skimmed-off&#34; by such narrow gap or opening 26. Thus, the provision of a narrow gap or opening 26 produces easy separation of the fiber flocks or the like from the clothing 13. \\n     As previously mentioned, the clothing 13 consists of a plurality of teeth 13a. The above-mentioned air ring can be considered to be made-up of an inner sub-ring and an outer sub-ring. The inner sub-ring comprises the air located between the teeth 13a, and thus, has a thickness which is essentially equal to the height of these teeth 13a. Its maximum diameter is equal to that of the roller envelope or outer surface 12a. The outer sub-ring is located beyond the inner sub-ring and its smallest diameter is equal to that of the roller envelope or outer surface 12a. The inner sub-ring of the bipartite air ring is removed from the immediate influence of the nose or nose member 21 since the latter cannot project into this inner sub-ring. However, such projection of the nose member 21 occurs in the case of the outer sub-ring, so that the latter can be influenced immediately by this nose member 21. Influence upon the complete air ring is thus greater the larger the part of the air ring which is under the immediate influence of the nose or nose member 21, that is the thicker the outer air ring in relation to the inner air ring. In correspondence with these observations, a tooth height up to approximately 5 mm proves to be especially advantageous with the present invention, because under these conditions considerable weakening of the air ring is possible. \\n     For the purpose of indication of further approximate dimensions it is here mentioned that with a tooth height of approximately 5 mm, there are advantageously obtained low values of the required quantity of suction air through the suction duct 23 with a mutual spacing of the screening wall 20 and roller envelope or outer surface 12a of approximately 2 mm at the nose 21 and of approximately 10 mm at the rear end 20a of the screening wall 20. When a closure wall 24 is provided an advantageous value for the width of the gap or opening 26 between the roller envelope or outer surface 12a and the nose or nose member 21 is approximately 2 mm and an advantageous value for the width of the gap or opening 27 between the roller envelope or outer surface 12a and the edge of the closure wall 24 adjacent the roller envelope or outer surface 12a is also approximately 2 mm. \\n     While there are shown and described present preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be distinctly understood that the invention is not limited thereto, but may be otherwise variously embodied and practiced within the scope of the following claims. ACCORDINGLY,\",\n          \"TECHNICAL FIELD \\n     The present invention relates to a knitted lingerie article corresponding to what is currently marketed under the name \\u201cboxer short\\u201d and which generally designates a short knitted underpants, for men as well as for women of all ages. It is understood here that the term boxer short is not limited to the short underpants but also extends to long underpants, for example of the type known under the name \\u201clong boxer short\\u201d, \\u201clegging\\u201d, etc. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     The boxer short is a relatively complex article as it is intended to cover the low part of the trunk as well as the top part of the thighs over a sufficient length. It comprises a panty portion ended at its upper portion by a belt positioned at the waist, and at its lower portion by two lapels separately positioned on the thighs. It is commonly made from a knitted tube corresponding to a diameter allowing to seamlessly dress the low part of the trunk, and is equipped during a confection operation of a sewn crotch bottom allowing to link the two tubes dressing the thighs. We know how to knit on the circular machines such as the machines SANTONI of SM8-8 type, for example for diameters comprised between 10 and 16 inches (between 25 and 40 cm), tubes intended for of the confection of boxer shorts with a double belt in the top portion and a double lapel in the low portion, this tube may be knitted in both directions (belt-lapel or lapel-belt). We also know the confection of the tube bottom to make the low part of the boxer short, with an attached bottom which can be made on the same type of knitting machine. According to the known prior art of documents US2000073 and FR2805285, the crotch bottom or gusset is a substantially rectangular piece which is put between the edges of two slots or incisions performed at the front and at the back of the knitted tube. The enclosed  FIGS. 1 to 3  show in more detail this confection operation. The boxer short  101  is made in the shape of a knitted tube, with an upper belt  102  and a lower border  103 , where lapels or reinforcements corresponding to future thigh passages are formed or may be formed. The knitted tube  101  comprises a front face  105  and rear face  106  (in one piece since it is about a circular knitting). The portion  104  intended to form the front pocket of the boxer short intended to maintain the genitals is represented by hatching on the front face  105 . We proceed ( FIGS. 1 and 2 ) to a cutting operation creating an incision  107  at the front part  105  and an identical or different incision  108  at the back  106  of the knitted tube, in the middle, at its lower portion. The incision  107  has edges  110 ,  111  and the incision  108  has edges  112 ,  113 . Each incision  107 ,  108  is then laterally spaced apart and stretched, as suggested by the arrows of  FIGS. 1 and 2 , so as to put substantially, in the extension of one another, the edges  110 ,  111  on the one hand and  112 ,  113  on the other hand, and form thus substantially rectilinear bottom lines which are sewn together by means of a substantially rectangular crotch bottom  115  (called here \\u201cbottom lines\\u201d the lower edges of the front and the back of the tubular knitted fabric, intended to be sewn to one another, between the thigh passages, directly or by means of additional pieces of crotch bottom such as the gusset). The document FR2805285 had represented an improvement compared to the classical confection by providing bottom lines with a different length at the front and at the back and by making the crotch bottom  115  with different elastic zones at the front and at the back. This suggestion has allowed to partially solve an often encountered problem with this type of garment, namely the absence of wearing comfort, related in particular to the presence of troublesome seams at the crotch and/or to a bad conformation of this bottom to the anatomy of the wearer, and more particularly to the presence of troublesome seams on the front at the genitals, in particular for man. However, the wearing comfort remains to improve further and this is the purpose of the present invention. More precisely, it is about finding a new method for the confection of the crotch, remaining simple, but leading to an improved comfort. \\n     We know, from the documents WO 2012087210 and WO 2011008138, two methods for the confection of boxer shorts from two knitted rectilinear strips which are applied one on the other. These documents teach that it is possible to tie the two strips together according to some patterns of parallel or T lines which are then incised, so as to give rise to particular crotch shapes. These two methods do not relate to the confection of the boxer shorts from tubular knitted fabric and do not give transposable teaching to this manufacturing method. \\n     BRIEF SUMMARY \\n     The purpose of the invention is achieved thanks to a method for manufacturing a boxer short comprising the circular knitting of a main tube, the preparation of a crotch bottom, the cutting in the low portion at the front and at the back of the incisions tube, the opening by lateral extension of the incisions to form first and second globally transverse bottom lines and the sewing of the crotch bottom to the globally transverse bottom lines for forming the crotch and the thighs passage and for confectioning the boxer short, characterized in that we cut, respectively at the front or at the back, two incisions forming, by opening of the incisions, a first globally transverse bottom line composed, on the one hand, of a low transverse edge and, on the other hand, of a top transverse edge of bottom line rising higher than the low transverse edge, in that at least one incision is cut, respectively, at the back or at the front, forming, by opening of the incision, a second bottom line having at least one low transverse edge, in that the crotch bottom is prepared in the shape of at least one crotch piece, and in that said low transverse edge of the first bottom line is sewn to a portion facing the low transverse edge of the second bottom line and in that the at least one crotch piece is sewn between the top edge of the first bottom line and a portion facing the second bottom line. \\n     Preferably, particularly for a male garment, it is at least at the front that the two incisions are cut, the back may have just a single incision. It is indeed at the front that it is mainly appropriate to improve the comfort of the garment. However, it is possible to provide a boxer short where the two incisions are provided at the back and only one at the front. It is also possible, and sometimes even advantageous, to provide a boxer short where the front as well as the back include two incisions. \\n     The incisions may be formed at the front and/or at the back of the knitted tube by simple symmetrical incisions with respect to the median vertical axis of a front or rear face, which are vertical or slightly oblique with respect to the vertical. The incisions are preferably rectilinear, but may also be curved, formed of segments, etc. \\n     The two incisions formed on the front (or rear) side, are in a preferred embodiment, two substantially vertical and symmetrical incisions with respect to the median axis of the boxer short. When the knitted fabric is laterally stretched to open these incisions and form the first globally transverse bottom line, a kind of central tab is formed between the incisions, the edge of which will constitute the low transverse edge of the bottom line, surrounded on either side by two lateral ends of bottom line rising higher than the tab edge. In this case the crotch bottom is prepared in the shape of two separate crotch pieces; the low edge of the front tab is sewn, situated in the middle of the first bottom line, in the middle of the second facing bottom line and the two separate crotch pieces are sewn between the ends of the first bottom line and the ends facing the second bottom line. \\n     If the second bottom line is formed by a single incision, normally on the rear face, this second bottom line after lateral extension of the incision is substantially a rectilinear transverse or slightly arched line. Advantageously, the length of the cuts at the front and at the back is not the same: the length of the cut at the back is normally superior to that of the cuts at the front so as to form two transverse bottom lines which have a substantially equivalent transverse extension. \\n     Thus, according to this embodiment, there is a method for manufacturing a boxer short comprising the circular knitting of a main tube, the preparation of a crotch bottom, the cutting in the low portion at the front and at the back of the incisions tube, the opening of the incisions for forming first and second bottom lines and the sewing of the crotch bottom to the bottom lines to form the crotch and the thighs passage and for confectioning the boxer short, characterized in that we cut at the front two incisions forming, by opening of the incisions, a first bottom line composed, on the one hand, of a low edge of front tab between the two incisions and, on the other hand, of two lateral ends of bottom line rising higher than the tab edge, in that an incision is cut at the back forming, by opening of the incision, a second bottom line, in that the crotch bottom is prepared in the shape of two separate crotch pieces, and in that said front tab edge is sewn, situated in the middle of the first bottom line, in the middle of the second bottom line and in that the two separate crotch pieces are sewn between the ends of the first bottom line and the ends of the second bottom line. \\n     The second bottom line is situated, after confection, at the rear side of the boxer short, so that the tab portion fastened thereto and which comes from the front portion, seamlessly surrounds, and therefore without discomfort, the genitals of the wearer. The two crotch pieces are rejected on the edges of the tab and participate in the formation of the thigh passages. \\n     In a variant of this same embodiment, it may be provided that the second bottom line is equally formed by two substantially vertical and symmetrical incisions, in which case there is formed by extension of the incisions, a central tab provided with a low edge: the low edge of the first tab is sewn on the low edge of the second tab and the separate crotch pieces are sewn between the ends facing the first and the second bottom line. In this variant, the length of the two cuts at the front and at the back is advantageously the same, so as to form two transverse bottom lines which have a substantially equivalent transverse extension. \\n     According to a second embodiment, the two incisions formed at the front and/or at the back of the knitted tube are in the shape of a double T incision, that is to say an incision including the T base starting from the edge of the knitted fabric and the T-bar transversely disposed at the base. When the knitted fabric is laterally stretched to open this double T incision and form the first globally transverse bottom line, a low edge is laterally formed on either side of a central portion of the bottom line which rises higher than the edge situated at the two ends of the bottom line. In this case a crotch bottom in the shape of only one separate central piece is prepared; the low double lateral edge situated at the ends of the first bottom line is sewn to the portions facing the ends of the second bottom line and the central piece is sewn separate from crotch between the central portion rising higher than the first bottom line and the central portion facing the second bottom line. \\n     The shape of the two incisions forming a T may admit variations: for example the branches of the T bar may be curves and/or may not be completely at right angle with respect to the T base. \\n     If the second bottom line is formed by a single incision, normally on the rear face, this second bottom line after lateral extension of the incision is substantially a rectilinear transverse or slightly arched line. Advantageously, the length of the cut at the back is superior to that of the T at the front so as to form, at the back and at the front, two transverse bottom lines which have a substantially equivalent transverse extension. \\n     In a variant of this same second embodiment, it can be provided that the second bottom line is also formed by two incisions forming a T, in which case a bottom line substantially resembling the first bottom line is formed by extension, with a low edge on either side of a higher central portion. The low edges facing the two bottom lines are sewn to one other, and the central piece separate from the crotch is sewn between the less low central portions of the facing bottom lines. In this variant as in the others, the length of the two cuts at the front and at the back is provided so as to form two transverse bottom lines which have a substantially equivalent transverse extension. \\n     Thus according to the invention, it is understood that the at least one of the two bottom lines obtained by incisions and lateral stretching is not exclusively rectilinear transverse but on the contrary, though always globally transverse, it comprises, on the one hand, a low transverse edge (in one portion, for example central portion, or in many portions, for example lateral portions) and, on the other hand, a top edge of bottom line rising higher than the low transverse edge (this top edge being possibly in two portions, for example lateral portions, or in one portion, for example central portion), whereby, when this non rectilinear bottom line is placed facing the other bottom line, the low edge can be directly sewn to the other line and the crotch piece(s) can be placed between the top edge and the other line. \\n     We used here the verb \\u201csew\\u201d, but it is clear that this term does not only cover the seam with a thread, but any method allowing to assemble edge to edge two textile pieces. \\n     As said above, the second bottom line is advantageously substantially rectilinear or arched in shape. It is understood that in this case, said low edge of the second bottom line extends over the entire length of the bottom line. \\n     The first bottom line is advantageously in the shape of broken line. \\n     The low edge of first bottom line (for example that of the tab in the first embodiment) may be formed by the low border of the circular knitted fabric itself, after possible unrolling of the lapel which was formed during knitting when appropriate, or long after a transverse complementary cut at the front, between the incisions, to remove the lapels. \\n     The crotch portion(s) is/are advantageously obtained also by knitting, the two pieces (when there are two) can be easily formed from a common draft, which may be obtained from a transversely cut strip. The crotch portion(s) can also come from another knitted fabric than the knitted fabric of the boxer short itself, another jersey type material. These two portions may, according to their material, possibly bring an additional benefit to the product: ventilation (\\u201cmesh\\u201d type material), anti-friction type material, anti-irritation treated material, etc. \\n     The invention also relates to a boxer short obtained by the method above. \\n     It is about a boxer short formed in a knitted main tube, including a front and a back linked in low portion by a crotch bottom separating two thigh passages, the low portions of the front and of the back ending with a first and a second bottom line globally transverse between which the crotch bottom is sewn, characterized by a first globally transverse bottom line composed, on the one hand, of a low transverse edge and, on the other hand, of a top edge of bottom line rising higher than the low transverse edge, a second bottom line having at least one low transverse edge, in that said low transverse edge of the first bottom line is sewn to a portion facing the low transverse edge of the second bottom line, and in that the crotch bottom is in the shape of at least one separate crotch piece sewn between the top edge of the first bottom line and a portion facing the second bottom line. \\n     In a particular case of embodiment, it is about a boxer short formed in a knitted main tube, including a front and a back linked in low portion by a crotch bottom separating two thigh passages, the low portions of the front and the back ending with a first and a second bottom line between which the crotch bottom is sewn, characterized by a first bottom line composed, on the one hand, of an edge of front tab and, on the other hand, of two lateral ends of bottom line rising higher than the edge of tab, in that the crotch bottom is in the shape of two separate crotch pieces, and in that that said edge of front tab, situated in the middle of the first bottom line, is sewn in the middle of the second bottom line and in that the two separate crotch pieces are sewn between the ends of the first bottom line and the ends of the second bottom line. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n       Other features and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description.

More precisely, \\n         FIG. 10A  describes the first preferred embodiment of the invention, with two front vertical symmetrical incisions, one back vertical incision, with in  FIG. 10 \\u2032A the illustration of the corresponding crotch. \\n         FIGS. 10B and 10C  are two variants of this first embodiment, where the frontal symmetrical incisions are oblique. \\n         FIG. 11A  describes an alternative variant of the first preferred embodiment of the invention, two front symmetrical vertical incisions, two back vertical symmetrical incisions, with in  FIG. 11 \\u2032A, the illustration of the corresponding crotch. \\n         FIGS. 11B and 11C  are two variants of this first embodiment, where the frontal symmetrical incisions are oblique. \\n         FIG. 12A  describes the second preferred embodiment of the invention, with two front T-shaped incisions, a back vertical incision, with, in  FIG. 12 \\u2032A, the illustration of the corresponding crotch. \\n         FIGS. 12B and 12C  are two variants of this second embodiment, where the incision forming the T-bar has a curved or oblique shape on the horizontal, with, in  FIG. 12 \\u2032C, the illustration of the crotch corresponding to  FIG. 12C . \\n         FIG. 13A  describes an alternative variant of the second preferred embodiment of the invention, with two front and back T-shaped incisions, with, in  FIG. 13 \\u2032A, the illustration of the corresponding crotch. \\n         FIGS. 13B and 13C  are two variants of this second embodiment, where the incision forming the front T-bar has a curved or oblique shape on the horizontal, with, in  FIG. 13 \\u2032C, the illustration of the crotch corresponding to  FIG. 13C . \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION \\n     The enclosed  FIGS. 4 to 8  show in detail the confection operation of a boxer short according to the invention according to a first preferred embodiment. As according to the prior art, the boxer short  1  is made in the shape of a knitted tube, with an upper belt  2  and a lower border  3  corresponding to future leg cuffs. The knitted tube comprises a front face  5  and a rear face  6 . It is further represented in hatching on the front face  5  of the portion  4  intended to form the front pocket of the boxer short intended to maintain the genitals. There is defined on the knitted tube a vertical direction going from the belt  2  at the top to the lower border  3  and a transverse direction, orthogonal to the vertical direction, and going from one side of a front or rear face to the other. \\n     According to the invention, we proceed ( FIGS. 4 and 5 ) to a cut operation creating two parallel vertical incisions  7  and  7 \\u2032 at the front  5  of the boxer short  1 : these incisions have edges  10 ,  11  and  10 \\u2032,  11 \\u2032 and form a tab  14  having a lower edge or low edge  16 . The lower edge  16  may be directly the edge of the knitted tube if the lapel is not formed yet, or be the edge of the tab  14  after dismantling the lapel, or even\\u2014and preferably\\u2014be obtained by the shortening of the tab  14  through an additional transverse cut (not represented) between the two incisions  7 ,  7 \\u2032. In practice, the contour portion  4  may advantageously go lower than it has been represented on  FIGS. 4 and 8  (to avoid confusing the reading) and come in the tab  14  between the two edges  11 ,  11 \\u2032 and almost until to its low edge to ensure more comfort to the genitals. \\n     We proceed at the back part  6  of the knitted tube to a central vertical incision  8 , creating two edges  12 ,  13 . \\n     We also prepared, preferably in a knitted fabric, two lateral crotch pieces  15 ,  15 \\u2032 in one piece  17  represented in  FIG. 6 , which can itself be obtained by cutting a long knitted strip. The piece  17  includes, on its two edges, borders  23 ,  23 \\u2032 with lapels corresponding to portions  3  of the tubular knitted fabric  1  intended to form the thigh passage. An oblique cut  18  allows to form, from the piece  17 , two pieces  15  and  15 \\u2032 symmetrical in rectangular trapezia. The piece  15 , represented on  FIG. 7 , includes, in addition to its reinforced edge  23 , parallel edges  1510  and  1513  and an oblique edge  1511 . \\n     We then go to the sewing of the crotch pieces  15 ,  15 \\u2032 on the knitted tube. For that, each incision  7 ,  7 \\u2032 is laterally spaced apart, in the transverse direction, so as to put the edges  10 ,  11  and  10 \\u2032,  11 \\u2032 substantially in the shape represented in  FIG. 8 , where they are at an obtuse angle together, always with the tab  14  therebetween and the edge  16  thereof at low portion. These elements form a broken front bottom line  10 ,  11 ,  16 ,  11 \\u2032,  10 \\u2032, in which the edge  16  is a low edge and the portions  10 ,  11 ,  11 \\u2032,  10 \\u2032 a top edge (with respect to the low edge). In the same time, the incision  8  is spaced apart so as to put the edges  12 ,  13  substantially in the extension of one another, as represented, so as to form a practically rectilinear rear bottom line  12 ,  13 . \\n     the low edge  16  is then sewn in the middle of the rear bottom line  12 ,  13 , in the portion facing the low edge  16 , and the lateral crotch trapezia  15 ,  15 \\u2032 are attached and sewn between the lateral portions of front bottom line  10 ,  11  and  10 \\u2032,  11 \\u2032 constituting the top edge and the ends of the rear bottom line  12 ,  13 . The lateral crotch trapezia  15 ,  15 \\u2032 therefore participate in the constitution of each thigh girth  19  by the reinforced edge  23 ,  23 \\u2032. \\n     The shape of the lateral crotch pieces  15 ,  15 \\u2032 is not limited to the trapezium. These pieces can also be triangular, or of other shape, and their edges are not necessarily rectilinear, but may be curves. Likewise, the rear bottom line  12 ,  13  represented rectilinear on  FIG. 8  can be arched, curvilinear or broken. \\n     An example of a boxer short obtained in accordance with the invention is represented on  FIG. 9 . It shows the lateral crotch pieces  15 ,  15 \\u2032, placed inwardly and forwardly of each thigh. The front edge  16  forms with the rear bottom line  12 ,  13  a seam  20  which extends more or less in an arc between the thighs; two sewing branches go from this seam  20 , sewing the lateral pieces  15 ,  15 \\u2032 at the edges  10 ,  11 ,  10 \\u2032,  11 \\u2032. The fact that the front edge  16  joins the rear bottom line  12 ,  13  situated at the back allows to carry to the back the seam and the resulting discomfort in a less sensitive zone, which significantly contributes to the improved comfort of the boxer short of the invention. \\n     The invention is particularly well combined with an embodiment of the front contoured portion in the more or less oval zone  4  shape surrounded by a peripheral marginal zone  21  made within a mesh different from that of the zone  4 , advantageously a more elastic mesh (higher elasticity module). \\n     On  FIGS. 4 to 8  the preferred embodiment of the invention was described in detail, but it will be seen on  FIGS. 10 to 13  that we can, without departing from the spirit of the invention, bring several modifications to what has been described, according to the exact way with which the two incisions are made on the face that receives them, and on the number of incisions on the other face. Figures are too schematic to allow to easily understand the principle of the modifications. The tube  1  is represented with its front face  5  and rear face  6 , either in perspective, or in a bottom view after assembling the crotch. \\n     On  FIGS. 10A and 10 \\u2032A is resumed the basic construction of  FIGS. 4-5 and 8 , with two symmetrical vertical incisions  7 ,  7 \\u2032 at the front and one  8  in the middle at the back, which allow to obtain a globally transverse bottom line at the front formed of a low central edge  16  and of a top double lateral edge  10 ,  10 \\u2032 (the vertical portion, which passes from one to the other, is neglected). This front bottom line cooperates with a substantially rectilinear rear bottom line to which it is directly sewn at the low edge  16 , and linked by means of the crotch pieces  15 ,  15 \\u2032 on the ends. \\n     The variations of  FIGS. 10B and 10C  are distinguished by the symmetrical slightly oblique position of the front incisions  7 ,  7 \\u2032. \\n     According to  FIGS. 11A and 11 \\u2032A, we provided two vertical symmetrical incisions  7 ,  7 \\u2032 at the front and  8 ,  8 \\u2032 at the back, thus this results in two quite similar front and rear bottom lines which are directly sewn to one another by their low edge  16  and on the sides by means of the separate crotch pieces  15 ,  15 \\u2032. \\n     The variations of  FIGS. 11B and 11C  are distinguished by the slightly oblique symmetrical position of the front incisions  7 ,  7 \\u2032. \\n     According to  FIGS. 12A and 12 \\u2032A, a vertical central incision  8  was provided at the back, and two central T-shaped incisions,  7 ,  7 \\u2032 were provided at the front, thus this results in that the rear bottom line is still rectilinear and that the front bottom line is characterized by a low edge  16  rejected on the sides while its top edge  10  directly formed by the incision  7 \\u2032 is central.

Such methods and devices serve the purpose, for example on a sectional warping plant, of enabling the uncovering of broken yarns that have continued to be wound prior to the beam coming to rest, without the formation of slack in individual yarns between the bobbin creel and the beaming machine. The unbroken yarns are accumulated with a definite yarn tension and in an ordered field, to be rolled out after repair of the broken yarn prior to the plant resuming its normal operating speed. \\n     German patent document DA 41 31 489 discloses a comparable and related device wherein the yarn warp is held with the aid of two warp clamping rollers prior to the reversal of the beam and the actual accumulation procedure. Reverse rotation of the beam and displacement of the accumulator rollers is synchronous, the drive control for maintenance of yarn tension ensuing via a jockey roller. Other state of the art methods and devices operate according to the same principle, with the yarns being clamped continuously on the bobbin creel side. \\n     A disadvantage of state of the art methods is that exact speed synchronisation between the accumulator device and the machine can only be achieved with difficulty and requires a relatively complicated control mechanism. Because the yarns are clamped on the creel side, even slight differences in speed can lead to over-stretching of the yarns to their break point, or to a drop below a minimum tension as soon as the jockey roller has reached its end position. Additionally, it is necessary to immediately open the yarn web clamp as soon as the accumulated yarn length has been rewound onto the beam, otherwise the clamping beam used for clamping the yarns on the creel side will lead to pinching of the yarns and subsequent fibre damage. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     It is therefore a purpose of the invention to create a method that enables protective and reliable accumulation of the yarns without complicated speed control. According to the invention, this purpose is fulfilled by the method and device described below. \\n     Sychronisation between the accumulation speed and the reversing speed, and thus a relatively complicated speed control, can be avoided in a surprisingly simple way if, in the absence of exact control, a slight speed difference is maintained and if the resultant length difference is compensated for by means of further withdrawal of yarns from the bobbin creel. For this purpose, it is merely necessary to subject each yarn to a defined tension, and this is usually anyway required in order to maintain tension in the yarn sheet. When accumulating the yarns, the maximum yarn length able to be accumulated does not have to be defined in terms of an exact number of centimeters. It is more important, however, that the yarns do not exceed a maximum permitted tension. This can be ensured simply by means of further withdrawal of the yarns from the bobbin creel, with only a negligible reduction in accumulation capacity having to be reckoned with. \\n     Prior to reverse rotation of the beam, the yarn warp, running in the spread position for the beaming procedure, is preferably brought into one plane by means of accumulator rollers, the yarn lengths taken up in this case being further withdrawn from the creel. \\n     As opposed to the state of the art, it is thus not necessary to apply initial clamping on the bobbin creel side before the accumulator rollers are brought into contact with the yarn warp. Rather, bringing together of the yarn sheet can be attained by the accumulator rollers themselves. \\n     In order to deflect the yarn sheet from a central position, a lead-in guide roller can, when collecting up the yarn warp into the common plane, be moved into the yarn warp on the creel side, said yarn warp remaining in a central position while the accumulator rollers can be further displaced for the formation of loops. As opposed to state of the art clamping in the central position, the yarn warp is now solely deflected around the lead-in guide roller, without clamping. The lead-in guide roller can be moved either from above or from below into the yarn warp. On reaching the mid-position, a switching device can be activated, said switching device actuating the reverse run of the beaming machine. Reverse delivery of the yarn length is here always slightly shorter than the accumulated length. Length compensation ensues, as before, by means of further withdrawal from the creel. \\n     Roll-out of the overlength can be achieved in a particularly simple way if the accumulator rollers are returned to their start position while the beam is inched forwards under power, wherein the crawling speed is greater than the roll-out speed of the accumulator rollers and wherein the length difference arising from the difference between the crawling speed and the roll-out speed being compensated by further withdrawal from the creel under the influence of yarn tensioners. Also in the case of roll-out, a slight partial length is with that continuously withdrawn from the creel so that a constant yarn tension can be maintained over and above the said speed difference. \\n     A further purpose of the invention is to create a device with which the method described above can be carried out by simple constructional means. According to this invention, the lead-in guide roller on the creel side serves to introduce the yarn warp into the device without clamping, indeed into a central position that permits the formation of yarn loops upwards and downwards. The first yarn loop can here commence directly on the lead-in guide roller. \\n     In the mid-position, the lead-in guide roller can activate a switching device for reversing the beam. Likewise, at least an upper and lower sensor can be arranged within the zone of movement of at least one accumulator roller, the end of the accumulation procedure or roll-out procedure being sensed by the sensors. \\n     The traction mechanism can possess endless displacement chains running at the side of the machine frame around upper and lower chain deflection rollers, with an upper or lower accumulator roller being placed on each span of an endless chain. \\n     A particularly advantageous construction for the accumulator device will result if it possesses a drive module and at least one detachable accumulator module mounted on the drive module, both the drive device for the traction mechanism and the lead-in guide roller being arranged in the drive module. In addition, the drive module can possess an upper and lower accumulator roller, so that even with only a drive module, restricted accumulation of yarns would be possible. Further accumulator modules can be attached to the drive module, each accumulator module having in each case an upper and a lower accumulator roller. The drive module&#39;s traction mechanism is connected either to the drive module or the preceding accumulator module. The maximum accumulated length can be determined by the number of accumulator modules connected. \\n     The expressions &#34;Accumulator Roller&#34; and &#34;Lead-in guide Roller&#34; relate preferably to a cylindrical body mounted to rotate with low resistance, around which the yarns can be deflected without damage. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n     An embodiment of the invention is shown in the drawings wherein: \\n     FIG. 1 is A highly schematic representation of a side view of a warping plant with an accumulator device between the creel and the beaming machine, \\n     FIG. 2 is a plan view of the plant according to FIG. 1, \\n     FIG. 3 shows the plant according to FIG. 1 during preparation of the accumulation procedure and, \\n     FIG. 4 illustrates the plant according to FIG. 1 during accumulation of the yarns. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT \\n     FIGS. 1 and 2 show a warping plant in normal operation, wherein warp yarns 2 are led in a vertically ray-formed and horizontally almost parallel yarn sheet from a bobbin creel 1 through an accumulator device 3, and are wound by a warping machine 4 via a guide roller 6 onto a warping beam 5. The yarns here move in the direction of the arrow a and the warping beam rotates in the direction of rotation b. The yarn warp 2 is, in the beaming position shown, led through the accumulator device 3 without making contact. \\n     Each warp yarn is provided with a controllable yarn tensioner 7 at a defined braking tension, and monitored by a yarn monitor 8. In the case of yarn breakage, the yarn monitor will trigger a stop of the warping machine 4, and simultaneously a defined increased yarn braking action on all yarn tensioners 7. Depending on the actual position of the yarn breakage, winding of the broken yarn onto the beam 5 may not, however, be prevented. For this reason, the warp already wound onto the beam must subsequently be ordered, at a defined tension, within the accumulator device 3, in order to expose the broken end. \\n     The accumulator device 3 comprises a machine frame 23 in which vertically and contrarotating mobile upper and lower accumulator rollers 13 and 13&#39; are mounted. The mounting and motion of the said accumulator rollers is attained via a traction mechanism 12 that is preferably formed by endless displacement chains on the paternoster transport principle. Each chain loop is mounted at the side of the machine frame around upper and lower chain deflection wheels 22 or 22&#39;, and in each case an upper and lower accumulator roller is attached at the centre of each chain span. Depending on the direction of rotation of the chain, the said accumulator rollers on neighbouring spans will move towards or away from one another. \\n     A lead-in guide roller 16 is arranged on the creel side, said roller also being able to be mounted in the same way on lateral chains. \\n     Preferably, the lead-in guide roller is mounted in bearings so as to dislocate, said bearings being mounted on a chain on which an accumulator roller is also mounted. This lead-in guide roller moves, however, only as far as a limit-stop/support 17 in a mid-position, at which point it is dislocated out of its support bearings while the chain moves further. The mid-position is approximately on the plane on which the upper and lower accumulator rollers 13 and 13&#39; cross. A press-switch 18 is provided on the limit-stop/support 17, with the beaming machine motor 20 being able to be controlled with the aid of said press-switch. \\n     The lead-in guide roller 16 is, together with a pair of accumulator rollers, arranged on a drive module 15, the drive module also supporting the accumulator drive motor 11 for the drive of the traction mechanism. An accumulator module coupled to said drive module supports a further pair of accumulator rollers. In addition, a lower limit sensor 19 and upper limit sensor 21 are arranged on the accumulator module. A presss-witch 10 is arranged on the beaming machine 21, with the accumulation and roll-out procedure able to be actuated on said press-switch. A defection roller 24 causes a common deflection of the yarn warp during roll-in and roll-out. \\n     In FIG. 3, the warping machine has been stopped via the affected yarn monitors 8. The yarn tensioners 7 are subjected to a raised braking force. The accumulator drive 11 is actuated by means of the manual presss-witch 10, the upper and lower accumulator rollers 13 and 13&#39; thus moving towards each other. Simultaneously, the lead-in guide roller 16 is lowered into the yarn sheet. Thereafter, the yarn sheet is continuously brought to a mid-position. The differential yarn lengths taken up in this case, although relatively slight, are withdrawn from the creel in the direction of the arrow a. The mid-position is reached as soon as the lead-in guide roller 16 has reached the limit-stop/support 17 and, with that, actuated the press switch 18. \\n     Only at this point is the beaming machine motor 20 reversed at a specific reverse speed. The upper and lower accumulator rollers 13 and 13&#39; cross and distance themselves one more, with yarn loops evidently being formed. With that, the beam rotates back in the direction c, and the already wound warp 9 is drawn into the accumulator device 3 in the direction of the arrow d. The reverse speed is, however, less than the accumulation speed of the enlarging yarn loops so that a differential length is withdrawn from the creel in the direction of the arrow a. Yarn tension is held at a constant, however. \\n     In to FIG. 4, the accumulator device 3 has reached its maximum capacity. The lower accumulator rollers 13&#39;, in the rest position, are now in the upper end position, and vice versa. Both the accumulator drive 11 and the beaming machine motor 20 have been switched off by means of the limit-sensor 19. The broken yarn is now exposed and can be retied. \\n     In order to roll-out the accumulated overlength, the manual press-switch 10 on the beaming machine is pressed once again. Then, simultaneous inching of the warp beam 5 and reversal of the accumulator drive 11 is actuated. The crawling speed is greater than the roll-out speed of the reducing yarn loops, the length difference so arising once again being taken from the bobbin creel 1. The roll-out speed is ended by actuation of the upper limit press-switch 21. All reverse and forward warp lengths are recorded by the guide roller 6. The machine has once again reached the start position shown in FIG. 1 and can assume normal beaming operations. \\n     Inasmuch as the invention is subject to modifications and variations, the foregoing description and accompanying drawings should not be regarded as limiting the invention, which is defined by the following claims and various combinations thereof:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7136,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"A card feed is disclosed in which, in order to prevent machine stoppages from causing the formation of permanent impressions in a fiber web delivered from a feed chute, a displaceable delivery roller is movable on the occasion of a machine stoppage by means of a pressure-operated reciprocating actuator from an operative position, in which the fiber web is being compressed between a pair of delivery rollers, into another position in which the fiber web is no longer compressed to an extent such that a permanent impression would be produced in it during the period of machine stoppage.\",\n          \"The invention is directed to a hydroentangled nonwoven wipe, the outer surface of which exhibits highly entangled fibers whereas the inner layer exhibits lightly entangled fibers.
